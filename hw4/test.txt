HURL on the lance! Break up the ancient peace! Now let the arrow hiss in air and sing; Now let the spear-point on the armor ring; Sound forth the call to wars that never cease!  Ye hoot the yellow Mongol from your land; But forth to regions all his own ye go To reap the riches of his overflow, And just ye call the working of your hand!  Now see the scramble of the Christian host-- Them all press forward for the spoil that's won; New wars! new wars! ris'n on the olden one-- And this, this the enlightened freeman's boast!  But greater is the strife than here would seem, And wider realms embracing than the East, For that is but the remnant of the feast. I had a vision. (Was it all a dream?)  The weary Titan groaned beneath the weight Of nations growing weaker day by day, Whose men he deemed but men of minor clay, And destinies he wrought for them their fate.  And why, methought, does not the giant's creed Cast off the weaklings that would warp his might, And leave alone the wretches in their plight? No answer save "I would not" from his greed.  So freedom hails th' advance of king and queen; The march of mind goes on o'er field and flood; Republics curb the weak with shows of blood; And lordly priests profess the Nazarene!  Yet hear the trumpet and the cannon's roar, The orphan's crying and the widow's wail; But what of them? Unfurl the sail! flay! flail! On! on! on to the mighty breach once more! 
I drew a picture long ago — A picture of a sullen sea; A picture that I value now Because it clears Life’s mystery. My sea was dark and full of gloom; I painted rocks of sombre hue. My sky alone bespoke of light, And that I painted palest blue. But e’en across my sky of blue Stretched troubled clouds of sodden gray, Through which the sun shone weak and dim, With only here and there a ray. Around my rocks the yellow foam Seemed surging, moaning in despair As if the waves, their fury spent, Left naught but desolation there. Three crafts with fluttering sails I drew, And one sailed near the rocks of gray, The other on its westward course, Went speeding out of danger’s way. The other still outdistanced them Where sky and water seemed to meet. I painted that with sails full set, And then my picture was complete. My life was like the sullen sea, Misfortune’s woes, my rocks of gray; The crafts portrayed Life’s changing scenes, The clouded sky Life’s troubled Day I long to paint that picture o’er, Without the rocks of sombre hue; Without the troubled clouds of gray, I’ll paint the sky of brightest blue. My sea shall lay in calm repose, No hint of surging, moaning sigh. My crafts, unhindered by the rocks, Shall speed in joyous swiftness by. But this will be when brightest hours Of hope and cheer are given me. I’ll paint this picture when Life’s sun Shines clear upon Prosperity.
Twas a bright Christmas morning in "Ole Kentuck"; Aunt Sallie was busy disrobing a duck- A featherless turkey close by her side lay, Prepared for the dinner that bright Christmas day. 'Twas a family reunion, and Uncle Joe Moore And his good wife Aunt Sallie, both ten and threescore, Had gathered around them their "girls" and their "boys," With these "children's" children - the grandparents' joys. The "girls" (all past thirty) were helping to make The "sweet tater puddin's," the pies, and the cake; The "boys" and the grand-boys the fires were making, The oldest granddaughter the biscuits was baking, The little grandchildren a dozen or more Were tumbling about just outside of the door; While Uncle Joe Moore, the venerable sire, Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire. When the clock tolled the midday the feast was complete, And after each member had taken his seat, The venerable sire rose up from his chair, And with uplifted arms he offered this prayer: "We thank Thee, our Father in heaven," he said, "For the abundance of good things before us now spread; We thank Thee, dear Lord, that I and my wife Have been spared by thy goodness to reach an old life; We thank Thee, of all things, the sweetest and best, For our dear children's presence from North, South and West. Continue Thy blessings, Thy goodness, Thy love, And prepare us to meet Thee in heaven above." The grace being over the feast was begun. The duck and the turkey were carved one by one; The big chicken pot-pie received the same fate, And a generous helping was piled on each plate. After the meats came the puddings and pies; Then how the grandchildren all opened their eyes When one of their uncles from far Illinois Brought out from the closet a basket of toys. As dinner was over, the venerable sire Rose up from his seat and stood by the fire, Where he called to his side each lamb of his fold, And blessed and caressed them like Jacob of old. "What changes we've seen, Sal," remarked Uncle Joe, "These years we've been married, some forty or so. Now let me see, forty? Yes, forty-one years Today, since we met at Uncle Bill Steer's. I remember, ole 'oman, you looked mighty gran', And I was then, children, er good-lookin' man. I walked with your mother from Clayton that night, And 'fore we got home, why I got in a fight. Tom Scott, a 'patroller,' insulted your mother, So I knocked him down, and Ed, his big brother. I then asked your mother if she'd be my wife. Her answer was: 'Yes, Joe, since you risked your life For me up the road, and licked old Tom Scott, Yes, I'll be your wife; why, Joseph, why not?' But the next day, my children, my master sold me To an ole Nigger trader' from East Tennessee, Where I worked on a farm without seeing your mother For eighty long days, till me and another. Plantation hand run away and met with good luck, For we soon found ourselves on the soil of Kentuck. 'Fore my ole master knowed I run erway We two was married that same Christmas day. We was married at Scottsville by ole Peter Brown, Who was a white minister that lived in the town, And would marry us slave folks no matter or not If our masters was willing, if we only had got A couple of chickens or a barrel of corn. The very next Christmas our Lucy was born, And the next of the past that I now can remember Is when we moved here the following September. Then came the war, Sal, and ole marster died, While Missus and you, Sal, stood by his side. Then I left you and children, and went out to fight For the Union and Freedom one warm summer's night. Then good Abr'am Lincoln, he sot us all free, And we had in the county a big jubilee. Then you boys and you girls all worked hand to hand To buy me and your mother this house and this land. Then some of you married, and some went out West, While me and your mother, along with the rest, Stayed on the old homestead and worked night and day, A farming and trucking, and made the work pay. We are glad for to meet you all back here once more, And see your dear babies together, before  Sat smoking his pipe with his back to the fire. Me and your mother (we are both old and gray) Receive old Death's summons to call us away. God bless you, my children, through life, is my prayer," And the venerable sire sat down in his chair. The rest of the evening was passed in a measure Receiving old friends or by chatting in pleasure Till long after midnight, with hearts light and gay. 'Twas a happy reunion that bright Christmas day.
He was a noble hero, born in an humble state, But with a will like Nero, his cruel chains did break. If in the glorious transept, worth and fitness reign, If in the unknown regions, all are rewarded the same, If to the hero modern, honor is rightly given, His is a sapphired crown in the bright kingdom of heaven. Tell of sagacious raids on the black tiller of soil, Bringing from under-byways Into freedom's sunshine and joy. Tell of the noble plea the companion of martyred John Brown, Earth but records - heaven rewards The worthy with worthy renown. Tell of the noble traits of character true as steel, Tell of the fear-fraught days which every true patriot feels. Tell of the powerful mind that forces the just decree, Fair Ethiope placed with thee her hopes in blessed security. Wet are the cheeks of millions; loudly do they lament, Whence thou art swiftly riven from the mundane transient. Death- unsatiable devourer thou checkmate of good men's deeds, - Visiting earth each hour, unmindful of worldly needs, But to thy name and prestige, posterity ever lauds, Honor in life, happy in death, near the throne of the living God. 
Who casts a slur on Negro worth, a stain on Negro fame? Who dreads to own his Negro blood, or hear his Negro name? Who scorns the warmth of Negro hearts [illegible] the clasp of Negro hands? If he but shows his traitor's face, we [illegible] him where he stands.  The Negro's blood! Its crimson tide has watered hill and plain Wherever there were wrongs to crush, or freemen's rights to gain. No dastard thought, no cowardly fear his had it tamely by When there were noble deeds to do [illegible] to die.   The Negro's heart! The Negro's heart! God keeping pure and free The fullness of its kindly thought its wealth of honest glee; Its generous strength; its ardent faith; its uncomplaining trust; Though every worshipped idol break and crumble into dust.  The Negro's hands! Ah, lift them up. made strong by honest toil. The champion of the Civil War and of the Cuban soil: Their battle swords they flash aloft, though death in front they see ; The Negro's hands did valiant deeds tot brave Cuba free.  They bore the old flag bravely, and were there at Lincoln's call. They stood beside the foremost rank, with the bravest of them all. And when before the enemy's guns they held the Gray at bay — O never could the Afric heart beat prouder than that day.  So if some proud Caucasian cavils at the darkness of your race, Or speaks in scorn of Africa before her children's face, Then lay aside the flag of truce, and denounce him where he stands  For Negro's worth and Negro's fame were won by Negro's hands.

O, country, 'tis of thee, Land of the Lynching Bee,    Of thee I sing. How long will this base wrong Pollute thy freedom's song? Perpetrated by a throng    Of heartless fiends. My native country, thee, How I long to be free!    Thy name to love. I long to se ethe time When this most heinous crime Will be changed to deeds divine,    Like those above. Let wailings swell the breeze, And ring from all the trees:    "God's will be done." Let mortal souls awake-- Let all that breathe partake-- This spell of crimes to break,    Ere the nation's gone. O gracious God, to thee, In thine all-wise mercy,    We now appeal! May this land soon be brought Out of this doome it's wrought; For long, in vain, we've sought    Freedom to feel. 
A SIGH is breathed from million heart. From Slavery's chains set free: A million tongues now sadly cry, Great teen, we weep for thee'  Our Queen is dead; for her all mourn. In hamlet, palace, hall. My Queen is dead!" a warrior cries, In a lonely Zulu Kraal.  Though high of race, in power and place. Thy woman's love, O Queen, O'er every land. from Britain's Isle To Afric's sand was seen.  The lowliest found in thy domain Justice to Truth allied; Tyrants who boast that " might is right." Soon pass beyond thy tide.  Thy virtue set a nobler goal, Which all might seek to find; Man calls his fellowman his friend, Nor asks his hue or kind.  Ye heard, sad victims of man greed. Her Sovereign voice, which said "On Britain's sacred soul the slay In chains shall never tread"  "Soon as the bondman's weary feet Shall press its holy crust. That moment he a free man stand- This shackles fall to dust  On snow-clad [illegible] the North Star smiles Our guide in days of grief. But sorrow fled, and joy was found Neath the Crown and Maple leaf  And now in solemn silence be Bengali, Bedouin; In palm-clad isles; 'neath Orient skies Proud Turk and Fellaheen.  While Afric's sons, wherever found, In free and blest manhood, Revere the name of England's Queen: Victoria the Good.   Published in Colored American Magazine
It was a dream, a dream of happiness, A dream of love, so filled with melody , I scarce could breathe for its intensity : It was a dream that only girlhood dreams.  It came upon me in the month of June,    When all the birds were singing in the air,    And Nature was her loveliest , and fair: Oh ! it was sweet, too sweet to end so soon.  I'm older now and wiser, and my dreams,    Those winged messengers of thoughts,    Are not so youthful, nor so folly fraught: They now are dreams that only women dream.
I. THE trees are bare, wild flies the snow,    Hearths are glowing, hearts are merry — High in the air is the Mistletoe,    Over the door is the Holly Berry. Never have care how the winds may blow,    Never confess the revel grows weary — Yule is the time of the Mistletoe,    Yule is the time of the Holly Berry. II.  Come trip a measure, Let the heart be gay, Yule grants a pleasure None can say us nay. Let the song be merry , Be it fast or slow Hope is in the Holly -Berry, And Love in the Mistletoe . Of the year, the sadness 'Tis we rememberNow is time for gladness Here in December . High may drift the snow , Winds may lift and carry— But Love comes with the Mistletoe , And Hope with the Holly -Berry. III. What makes the house so quiet today ? Children , you really must go and play . This is the time for holly and joys,- Here, my pets , are your books and toys . See , papa will blow your new horn , Ned And shall he read a tale from your book, Fred? And baby can rattle here on my knee No? Won't take to my terms for a spree? Mary, my little woman, my dear, Come ... child be brave , brush away that tear ...Oh God ! my darlings how can we be gay, And this, Mother's first Christmas away! IV.  A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East , And o'er a city shone, where men were gay with wine and feast ; Shawms were sounded , and maidens made the lutes sweet with song, And a cry for the King went forth from the heart of the throng . Dancers performed for the guests with jewelled ankles and ears , And the riotous deep applause went forth sounding the doom of years. A large bright Star came out of the East-the mystic East ! And shone on two who walked away from the noise of the feast . On the hill-side the weary two , to a stable made their way , To share with kine the chilly place till comes the break of day . The woman dreamed in her sleep that night , woke in pain and smiled The dream was but the light of a Star, the coo of a little child . V.  December comes , snows come ,    Comes the wintry weather ; Faces from away come    Hearts , must be together .       Down the stair - steps of the hours       Yule leaps the hills and towers- --Fill the bowl and hang the holly,    Let the times be jolly. Day comes , and night comes    And the guests assemble Once again the old dream comes    That I would dissemble.       Falls a shadow 'cross the floor ,        Seen !-and is seen no more. O that mem'ry would forego    The hanging of the Mistletoe .
My heart gives thanks for many things—    For strength to labor day by day, For sleep that comes when darkness wings    With evening up the eastern way. I give deep thanks that I'm at peace    With kith and kin and neighbors, too; Dear Lord, for all last year's increase,    That helped me strive and hope and do.  My heart gives thanks for many things;    I know not how to name them all. My soul is free from frets and stings,    My mind from creed and doctrine's thrall. For sun and stars, for flowers and streams,    For work and hope and rest and play, For empty moments given to dreams—    For these my heart gives thanks today.  Yes, Lord, my thanks for many things    But one thing thou hast given ,is best --- I thank thee for the song it sings,    I thank thee for its golden crest. Of all the gifts to man on earth    Love is the best, the good, the great: My soul has given a dream, love-birth:    I thank thee for the happy state.
Today 'tis sunny June, the breeze is soft    And pauses sweetly dying where I sit, Here in my dear old garden where aloft    The tuneful birds about me sing and flit.  And here today no longing breaks my calm .   No mad desire fraught with ceaseless strife , For roses, lilies, aloe-balls have balm    To sooth away the harsher thoughts of life.  This is the place to doze and sink to dreams    As all the while the roses bud and bloom, And sweet birds warble, and the murmuring streams.    And honeyed bees blend in harmonious tune.  So here today this fresh green June is sweet,    And in my garden dreaming o'er and o'er I drowse beneath its perfume and its heat    And fill my heart full of sweet nature's lore. 
Again when nature glows    With a sweet smile of tender rirent bloom; And when the fragrant rose    Makes ordorous the air with its perfume;  The happy June descends    Amid us, with her softly warbling birds, Whose winging concert blends    Euphonious, sounds too full and sweet for words. 
Dear one, when we are wed in happy bliss,    When cares and heart -aches from our lives are gone , No bitter strife will stoop our souls to kiss    For peace from mated love will then be born .  A little world made up of you and I—    We two a whole creation , soul and heart , Where I will be as sun in June's soft sky ,    And thou the moon , our world's serener part .  And in our world of love will be no drouth ;    The hours will be as flowers , fair and sweet ; Kissed ever by soft breezes from the south    Low-winnowed with bird songs for lovers meet .
Love one word more Before you go— Some sweet, sad thing Remembering , Alas, to know--- Some hope you fed, some glance you gave, Dead, now in Love's deep grave.  So speak, and then depart, And I will keep The best of you forever in my heart . All else shall sleep As if Death came and taught me to forget . All but the best, That your loved memory live In my sad breast. 
Two on the cliffs by the purple sea, With the waves unbound and the sea -winds free; Wound in the mesh of its sobbing tone. And the tangling swirl of the sun-kissed foam . Two hand in hand by the glad, old sea, With but one sweet dream for you and me.  The sea's soft sigh on reef and shore, Two hearts keep rythm for ever more, Blue of the sea and the sky are one, And two hearts beating in unison. O rhyme of the ages, sweep of the sea, And two souls thrall'd in its mystery.
Today I woke and looked upon the heath    And odorous breath Of lilies, and the sweet geranium,    With the low hum  Of birds, spoke softly to my ears and said :    "He who was dead Lives once again — He rose 'twixt day and night    In samite white.  And all the morn grew flush'd in subtle bloom;    All death's sad gloom Vanished; and joy, as when His foot touched earth    Sprang into birth."  Then one did seem to stand in field nearby,    And loudly cry: "Step blithely midst the flow'rs, for I am He    Of Calvary.  And when thou, too, hast borne thy cross thro' life,    And won the strife , Like me, shalt thou emerge from death and rise    With this great prize:  "Life's raiment cleansed with precious blood of mine;    And radiant shine Beside my Father's throne, three lilies in thine hair,    As crown shalt wear."
The tender notes of Philomel    Heard far in the star -lit woods , Are not so sweetly audible    As the music of thy moods . The hue of the woodland lily    By the verge of the forest pool , Glows not with such chaste, sweet beauty    As thy pure and gracious soul.  As the nightingale sings of the rose,    So my heart sings ofthee As the moon in the garden glows    So glows thy soul to me. As heart to heart inclines    When Love's sweet skies are blue, So Beatrice, my soul divines That my love is all for you!
Far up in the cathedral, so they tell ,    There lived the lonely hunch-back all day long    No thought but of the church -bells, great and strong, And deaf but feeling full the chorus swell:— 'Tis holiday! O! come! my Gabrielle!    And all the rest of ye, pour out your song!    Why stand ye idle, lagging there? Ding! dong! O! Thibauld, sound your deep, reverberant cell! O! Sparrows, yield the sweetness that ye bring!    O! Pasquier, forth your piping music hurl       To th' multitude below, and all earth fill! Awake! awake! awake to life and sing!    But lo! behold ! she comes, the dancing girl!       The ringer's heart leaps, but the bells are still .
Beyond the hilltops to the north and west.    Beyond the dells, and past the pleasant streams.    Beyond the lakes that murmur in their dreams The liquid fancies of their silver rest-―- In such sweet thoughts as haunt a poet's breast--    (For lakes are poets, Love) there dwells my theme's    Sweet idol, you, Beloved , O Love, it seems That of all women you are first and best!    I love you deeply, and my soul would prove Its passion. Dearest, on this page for you. What shall I say ?—O Love, believe me true!    Ask lake and hilltop if they know my song :       Ask stream and dell, and airs that bear along          My soul's blown odors , if they know my love. 
I dreamed a dream, and, in my dream, I heard One wail at midnight by a convent's walls. And, as he wailed, he clutched the stars, and shook The pillars of the firmament of God, And rolled the thunders of Olympus down On men; and they besought their holy ones To plead with him ---lest he might spoil the world.     His face was bronze; his limbs were bronze but steel; His mane was blacker than the Steeds of Night. And his great eyes flashed warnings from beneath A citadel where daring thoughts abode. A comely youth---why needed he to weep?       Alas! upon his brow he wore the brand Of degradation, and upon his neck A circlet galling as a crime!--And from The cursed thing a chain of hate e'er bound Him where he stood. His hands were manacled; His limbs wore thongs that cut the flesh agape, Until, for the pure pain, he writhed and wept,--- As weeps a conquered god-the prisoner of Despair! He flung himself upon his knees, and burst into a prayer:        "O God, and hast Thou made me for these miseries? I feel Myself a man ---I have the spirit and The hopes of one. O, why, then, must I strive And fail?---No lake is clearer than my soul; No ship is prouder; none more tempest tost. 'Tis true my brow is dark; but, in the night, My spirit walks the stars, and lightly spurns. Its kinship to this world!---Lord, I have tried; The burden of the failure rests with thee." So fell he tranced.        But, on the plain there rose A phantom of the silent sphinx---the grim, Spell-casting thought of some deep master dead. And lo! beside its ancient, crumbling base, Napoleon, fresh from mighty deeds of war, Halted his band, and spoke in tones of awe.— All this I saw, and dreamed that yet---aye, yet!— The race might rise that built the awful thing That holds its secret still in Egypt's sands.

It was in the magic city, in Apollo's temple there,— 'Mid scenes of brilliant splendor , and enchanting beauty rare; 'Mid domes and spires and minarets ; lakes, groves, and flowers and streams , And music sweet as singing in the City of Our Dreams! Thus set, Apollo's temple stood , as fair to mortal eyes As the palace of Aladdin in a land of paradise! And in its walls the president a levee held that day, To greet a grateful people o'er whose hearts his love held sway.  Crowned by the law's majestic power , and guarded by its might , The president stood smiling on the people , left and right ; And giving, with a stately grace, a friendly clasp of hand To any who might reach him -tho ' the humblest in the land . To a mighty organ's pealings , the procession moved along— Merchant and sturdy toiler mingling in the countless throng ; Proud dames and merry working girls- high, low; the young and fair The black and white , and many born in other lands were there .  But, look you! Yonder comes Czolgosz, the strippling , with bound hand , To strike , with serpent's venom, the chief ruler of the land! He has planned the deed with cunning , and will execute it soon---- Write, with inky black of Hades, “Murder " on the sky of noon! He would bathe the thrones of earth in blood -abolish law and love ; Thwart commerce ; ruin church and home-tear God from Heaven above ; Give lust free rein and crime a throne -set shame and terror free, And light, with burning homes , the mad, red hell of Anarchy !  The president had stopped to kiss a pretty little child , And pat its head ; then on the throng again he looked and smiled ; Now came the baby's mother ; next , Parker, the Negro , there ;- And when Czolgosz , and---two quick shots rang sharply on the air. You know the story: How the wounded president sank down ; And how brave Parker leaped and bore the assassin to the ground . I read it all, and, tho ' my tears fell ere I ceased to read, My heart beat higher as it told of Parker's noble deed!  That night I dreamed the scene again : Anon methought a change Transfigured all ---The moonlight filled the room with beauty strange , While ,thro ' an open doorway , surged the people ,wave on wave , To greet the ebon hero who had done a deed so brave . From every section of the land the grateful people came To load this mighty Son of Ham with trophies of his fame . And from far distant countries, in my dream it seemed to me, Came king and czar and emperor this fearless man to see .  This was not all : Methought the shades of the immortal dead In shadow forms , moved softly with the concourse , haply led By pity for the struggling Race of Man to lend their aid. In this dread hour . They came in robes of light and mist arrayed : There Moses , Plato , Shakespeare, Burns, John Brown and Douglass stood, August of mien , and grand of brow, in beauteous brotherhood ,- Some with the light of ages garlanded, but all aglow With holy glory , looming grand and god -like here below .  "What shall we give this Negro," cried the populace , as one- "How fittingly reward him for the deed that he hath done ? " Answered Kaiser William quickly , " In the Rhine -land , such as he Are knighted ; honored ; landed ; loved and feted royally !" Quoth Edward-—“ In old England , wrong is wrong and right is right ; And, were he there, we'd treat him like a Briton- black or white!" Then the Czar said : “To my Russia let this noble black be sent , Where to Pouskin, our black poet, we have reared a monument ."  Then Douglass said to Plato : "What said I of my race? Said I not the world judged wrongly, when it judged by hue of face ? Aye ! there are more noble in my race than there 'er were knaves or brutes , And they, like trees uncultured , may not yield their choicest fruits ." "Thou 't right," said Plato, nobly ; "he hath proved himself a man!---- Diogenes would name him so, could he his features scan ." And Moses said : "Amen! Amen!---I am made only men, As Burns hath sung ." And John Brown said : "I'd die for such again!"  "What shall thy gift be, Parker?" asked a man with blanching cheek . A Negro mother with her babe cried : "Speak ! In God's name , speak !" Then Parker said : “O, hear me ! This is my request I make ; And grant it, not for me alone ; but for my people's sake . Set us free to go as workers in the wide fields of the Lord ! We ask no special favors ; labor brings its own reward ! Strike the social chains from off us ; let us be as men 'mongst men— And we'll do you deeds as noble as are writ with human pen!  "We do not ask for seats around the white man's fireside , But for opportunities to work in fields to us denied— A chance to toil with willing hands at work God made us for, And not to do that which we hate, with self and God at war ! We want to live as free men ; not as half slaves 'mong the free, With free men's rights and homes in this fair Land of Liberty ! 'Tis not to enter white men's homes, but to enjoy our own In the land for which our fathers died-the only we have known!”  A consternation fell upon the throng , both young and old , As Parker's voice rang thro ' the hall in accents loud and bold . And 't was declared impossible to grant request so rash . "You tried to save our Chief, " one said. "What will you take in cash?" But Parker said : "Can it not be?" And Plato cried , "For shame!" And Moses rent his robes , and wailed : " It offendeth God's high name!" And Douglass wept, and John Brown's face grew stern, as wroth with man, As he heard his people cry : "Alas ! we can't; and who - who can?”  But , at that moment, in the door , a wondrous form appeared , And , as he clove the parting throng , the Immortals softly cheered . "It is the dauntless future," Plato cried , "the Mightiest!--- Who loveth mortals , and is , of Immortals , first and best !" The future stood majestic . Calm his brow was ; in his speech The awe and music of the waves that kiss the pebbly beach ; His face leonine , but fair ; and he spake , as the room grew still , "Tho ' ye think ye may not do so much, I can, I swear , and---will!"
Dar's mighty things agwine on,    Sense de days when I wuz young; An' folks don' do ez dey did once,    Sense dese new times is kum; Dey gals dey dresses pow'ful fin',    An all am fur a show; But enny how dis nigger    Am a-stickin' to de hoe. Larnin is a blessed thing,    An' good cloze mighty fin', But I likes to see de cullud gal    What knows jes how to ine, Gimme de gal to wash an' scrub,    An' keep things white an' clean, An' kin den go in de kitchin,    An' cook de ham an' greens. I ain't got no edekashun,    But dis I know am true, Dat raisin' gals too good to wuck,    Ain't never gwine to do; De boys dat look good nuf to eat,    But too good to saw de logs, Am karrin us ez fas' ez smoke    To lan us at de dogs. I spoze dat I'm ole fashun,    But God made man to plow, An git his libbin by de sweat    Dat trickles down his brow; While larnin an' all dem things    Am mighty good for sho', De bes way we kin make our pints,    Is---stickin' to de hoe.
A little urchin, ragged, black, an old cigar "stump" found, And visions of a jolly smoke began to hover 'round, When finding that he had no match, a big store he espied, And straightway for it made a bolt, to have his wants supplied.  "We have none here to give away; and even if we do, We have no match," the owner said, "for such a thing as you." Down in the ragged pantaloons the little black hand went, And forth it came, now grasping tight a big, old-fashioned cent.  "Gib me a box!" the urchin said,---his bosom swelled with joy, And calmly lighted his "cigar," a radiant, happy boy; Then handing back the box, he said, while his face with pride did shine, "Nex' time a genl'mun wants a match, jes' gib him one ub mine."
Seems lak folks is mighty curus     In de way dey t'inks an' ac's.   Dey jes' spen's dey days a-mixin'     Up de t'ings in almanacs.   Now, I min' my nex' do' neighbour,--     He's a mighty likely man,   But he nevah t'inks o' nuffin     'Ceptin' jes' to plot an' plan.

Why won't folks gin up dey plannin',     An' jes' be content to know   Dat dey 's gittin' all dat's fu' dem     In de days dat come an' go?   Why won't folks quit movin' forrard?     Ain't hit bettah jes' to stan'   An' be satisfied wid livin'    In de season dat 's at han'?

A crust of bread and a corner to sleep in,   A minute to smile and an hour to weep in,   A pint of joy to a peck of trouble,   And never a laugh but the moans come double;           And that is life!    A crust and a corner that love makes precious,   With a smile to warm and the tears to refresh us;   And joy seems sweeter when cares come after,   And a moan is the finest of foils for laughter;           And that is life!
Night is for sorrow and dawn is for joy,   Chasing the troubles that fret and annoy;   Darkness for sighing and daylight for song,--   Cheery and chaste the strain, heartfelt and strong.   All the night through, though I moan in the dark,   I wake in the morning to sing with the lark.    Deep in the midnight the rain whips the leaves,   Softly and sadly the wood-spirit grieves.   But when the first hue of dawn tints the sky,   I shall shake out my wings like the birds and be dry;   And though, like the rain-drops, I grieved through the dark,   I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.    On the high hills of heaven, some morning to be,   Where the rain shall not grieve thro' the leaves of the tree,   There my heart will be glad for the pain I have known,   For my hand will be clasped in the hand of mine own;   And though life has been hard and death's pathway been dark,   I shall wake in the morning to sing with the lark.
MINE is the humble duty and endeavor to relate A point of information that the hist'rics don't narrate. Of our country's cause and conflicts, and the progress she has made They tell us, but are silent on the part the Negro played.  We weren't at the discovery of this delightful land, But throughout its development is seen our humble hand . We felled the forests hewed the way for emigration's tide; We reaped the grain and hoed the fields of cane and cotton wide.  We led the first resistance against the despot's sway, When from our land he sought to take her liberties away. We fought throughout the conflict with unselfish resolution, And, vict'ry won, our suffrage helped to frame the Constitution.  'Twas not our fault our valor and devotion were forgotten; 'Twas not our choice that we were made the victims of King Cotton; Unwillingly we were the cause, unfortunate, that rent The Union we would willingly have suffered to cement.  Though our consent was not required, yet do we claim the merit Of multiplying hoards of wealth for others to inherit. Were half the country's lands and goods converted into gold, 'Twould not exceed the revenue for which our labor sold.  Our constant care and faithfulness were levied to provide Comfort and case for those by whom our freedom was denied. We tended them in infancy, in sickness and in age, No want of theirs, nor whim, that failed our service to engage.  And when dread palpitation shook the nation's troubled heart, 'Twas our peculiar destiny to play a triple part. While thousands fought their chains to break, some wrought to weld them faster; Others remained the home on guard to aid and succor master.  With internecine clouds o'erblown, and peace again returned,--- And amity and happiness with our assistance carned, Our service and our sacrifice we've failed not to devote, Our country's cause to honor and her glory to promote.  Then wherefore do our virtues all escape the public eye? Wherefore our imperfections do they seek to magnify? How can our land, our native land, her treachery excuse? The merit of our loyalty, how long will she refuse?  Of all the blood her freedom cost the Negro shed the first; Of all whom freedom ought to bless the Negro fares the worst. She never can repair the loss of what she took away; The debt of gratitude she owes she never can repay.  The hist'ries we peruse in vain in quest of what I've stated, Yet justice will admit my claim is not exaggerated. In peace, in war, in church and state, in letters and in art,--- In every worthy work and way the Negro plays his part.
As visions of the past, by memory led, From every opening vista crowd the mind, Till all our present duties fade---have fled, And Time rolls back to years far, far behind; If, by some strange enchantment we could be Then winged from matrons, back again to youth, Would we return once more to girlhood's glee Would we return? I ask. Pray, speak the truth!       Would you return?  Would you recall to earth, from peaceful sleep . Fond parents; have them break their heavenly rest, To toil again, to watch, to mourn, to weep O'er cares and troubles, only you know best? Would you return to fleeting youth again, And hush the prattle in your baby's cot Aft' all these years of care, of toil, of pain? A mother's feeling tells me I would not        Would you---return?
I OWN estate with shady bowers, Enthroned upon a tropic isle, With fragrant plants and fruits and flowers; Heaven and nature's sweetest smile Beams brightly on this vast domain; A princely mansion, large and bright, A host of servants in my train, Who do my bidding day and night — In Dreamland. There is a barren, rocky shorc (A few short leagues from my estate) With all the ills of life in store For him whose bark's driven there by fate; Privation, sickness, sorrow, death, And wicked demons of great might, Or harpies with sulphuric breath- 'Twas there I found myself one night - In Dreamland.
The silent air is musical with thought--- I hear the beating of the nation's heart ; It cannot hush the aching tears of grief Since one has passed into the perfect night , The people bow their heads in the belief He was a benefactor , faithful from the start. O hero, martyr and the nation's chief, The fragrant breathing of the silver chimes Is but the adieu; We see no more the placid face That stood to greet the benediction of a RACE.
THOUGH the day be dark and dreary    In our journey on through life, There will be a glorious sunset:   "Peace must always follow strife." When the Master sendeth sorrow,    In his own time he'll bring joy; Only wait the lovely morrow:    "Gold's too soft without alloy." When we frown o'er rainy weather,    Roaring winds and winter's shrouds, List! and hear the bright side whisper:    "There's a rainbow in the clouds." Cease from looking on the dark side;    Look around, behold the bright, And will find how many blessings    Have been hidden from our sight. Neither sorrowing nor complaining,    Only wait the Master's will; Hear his loving message saying:    "Only trust, I'm with you still." Lead us, Father, guide, protect us,    As through life we blindly roam; May we find, when toil is o'er, Rest at last in Heaven -- our Home. 
I LOVE a friend whose cheering voice Can soothe my aching heart; Can wipe the tears of grief away When sorrow bids them start. I love a friend whose gentle hand Removes the bitter cup of grief; Who binds the wounds he did not make, And kindly brings relief. I love a friend whose beaming smile Is like a ray of light, To cheer me on my lonely way Through sorrow's darksome night.
The waves dashed high; the thunders echoed far; The lightnings flashed into the dismal gloom The bolts by Vulcan forged in Nature's womb, And earth was shaken by the furious war! The Ship of State was strained in every spar! And strong men felt that now had come their doom; And weak men scanned the dark heavens for a star To save them from a fratricidal tomb. But, one, amid the strife—collected, calm, Patient and resolute—was firm, and trod The deck, defiant of the angry storm, Guiding the ship—like to some ancient god!    And high upon the scroll of endless fame,    In diamond letters, flashes Lincoln's name.
How charm'd is the car by this one, simple word! It quickens the pulse, though so often tis heard,    When fortune compels us to roam ; The buds of true promise will blossom anew , Becoming more fragrant with memory's dew,    When hearing the lov'd name of home.  Our childhood's fond joys, with our kindred around us, The innocent sports of our hearts that e'er bound us    To memories now ivied with years, The smile of that mother , so lovingly tender, Her musical voice we ever remember    The memory we sprinkle with tears.  Ah! yeş, on the tide of the outflowing years Drift pleasures of youth , which our fancy endears ,    On swells of this life's ocean foam; And thoughts ' heavy storms are no longer before us , For rainbows of love strew brilliantly o'er us ,    Those visions , enchanting, of home.  And flowers may bloom in the land where we dwell , And, living forever, in fragrance excel    All others that e'er meet the eye, And music's fond echoes may soothe us to rest , When warbled from birds in their leaf -cover'd nests ,    And well from the heart a deep sigh.  But mem'ry entwining the pleasures now past , Will cling to them fondly - grow green to the last    I care not the distance we roam ; And perfume of flowers and birds music gather'd But speak of the joys from which we are sever'd ;    The sigh --- to return to our home.
It was a twentieth century eden, mine ; A modern Adam, I; and for my Eve , God gave a winsome woman with senses fine Who deemed the cloth -of-life of golden weave. 'Mid trees whereon hung riches, pleasur, glory, Again thro ' eden's garden went we twain, Care -free and gay as when in ancient story The first fair Eve with Adam led the train Of all the living down the vernal vales, And threaded sun-flecked shadowed paths of paradise; Or rested at the noon in those sweet - scented bowers In trustful love, while drinking from each other's eyes Mutual content and joy and happiness for hours . The feast with plenty flower -crowned,    Sweet music's most enchanting strain, Dance with her deft and measured round ,       And lays          Of poet-praise Were ours: and counted not as vain .    Ah, eden days indeed ! days of delight    That melted into golden mist at night ! We drank from selfish satisfaction's cup,          Content , and toyed With life's ideals . Drank the dregs (ah, sorry sup!)          O fsin and cloyed. Riches, success, soft ease , and luxury Were our cup-bearers round our bounteous board , Disguised devil -gods, who from the tree Of life made their wit-stealing wine and poured For us a heaven-forbidden draught and smiled While merriment amused and sense beguiled . Then fled the joy, alack ! that filled the heart! Saddened companions, see, we sit apart! Oh, day of wrath ! alas, the fateful hour! O'er all our eden blew a blighting wind Stifling and sickening spirit , bird and flower ; Sapping our souls , for we had sinned!—had sinned! Dark sorrow's dismal night enwrapped us round, Our once calm bosoms were despair's abode: No balm for the soul's healing could be found! Close by our bower the wraiths of unrest rode, Unbridled fears were loosed , remorse was calling From the dim distance ne'er-agains appalling . I knew that naught in me with this fell state could cope, So led my sickened love into the house of hope.          And there ---ah, there:          Gloom and despair!    Clad in th' habiliments of woe,       How helpless hope is lying,    Her lamp of life is burning low,       Her attendant sisters dying :    Faith fainting , finds , alas ! too late       Friendship's best bonds are interest,    And gray -robed death she doth await,       His coming deems a welcome guest.    Love lifts her eyes to heaven in prayer       While her brightest stars are paling ;    But a gleam of blessing finds she there       The earth's a place of wailing;    "Tho' the arms that clasped her yesterday       When all the world was green and bright    Are loosed and gone for aye -for aye ,       Slinking away beneath the night . Then pointed love aloft, her eyes in sorrowing gaze, We heard an angel -voice from out a golden haze, Say soft in accents soothing , gracious , kind --- Delicious as sweet -scented south-land wind: "Ah , man ! ah, woman ! for each wasted year May you atone, God says !-But 'tis not here. Forth from your eden ! Leave illusion land, Go to the struggling poor , weep round the bier , The lowly lift and dry misfortune's tear ! Of every race, each is your brother man: Try what your loving ministrations can. Encourage him, remove oppression's heel , And with each daily doing learn to feel . Work , man ! work, woman , without recompense , Nor expectant of reward or grateful sense! Work for the land's uplifting , for the right : For work alone leads back again to light. God's law for restoration , earthly neighbor , Of thy soul - joy again from grief is LABOR!
A child is born; all in the Earth and Sky Chorus unending song at this great birth. The heavens are gorgeous with the holy glow Of the resplendent light; a herald star To the Wise Men (first pilgrims to his shrine), Loosed from the star -gemmed archway that impends Over God's golden throne, shot grandly thro' The firmament, and in crescendent brightness glowed When all its spell divine was spent, above His birthplace lowly.  In snow-white robes and breathing o'er the earth Celestial odors, God sent messengers Fluting glad Seraph -notes of joy to those Late-watching shepherds; diffused a soothing light About their path; and in angelic strains The cherubim adore the Infinite. The shepherds view the manger - cradled Child; Above the Heavens join their notes serene,-- And countless tribes of men hear that love-theme, Divinely beautiful.  On the Child's brow divinely radiant gleams The love-lit crown of Eden innocence: And Seraphim, majestic, beautiful, His courts attend; in choruses divine A choir invisible, through earth and sky Hymns to the warring sin -cursed Universe, Anthem of joyous praise, announcing Peace, Glory to God, and His good-will toward men.  Now Ocean, Earth and Sky Echo the Seraph song; the caves of Hell Groan back dull dirges of impending woe And fell defeat; while a choronal choir Of God's Archangels and Heaven's scraphs sings, "Lo! here the gift of God, comes down to men, The King of Earth, the Saviour of Mankind. Let blood-redeemed mankind welcome their King, Their Shepherd who from Calvary's Cross shall lead Frail sin-sick souls all sinless, back to that First Eden of their Father and their God. 
I was sitting by the are, On a cold, cold wintery might, Listening to the children's prattle In their joy and their delight. Of the foremost thought within them, "Santa Claus will soon be here, We can hear his sleigh-bells jingle Just the same as tho' he's near."  Then my heart grew sad for others, Many, many miles away, Father, mother, sister, brother, Thinking that same thought today. But their Christmas will be poorly, Not as bright as ours around, Yet they kneel and thank their Saviour. That he loves and does not frown Upon little country children. Just because they're not in town.  In my fancy now I see them, Feeding, milking, hauling corn; Then when night comes, getting ready Sack and gun, and hounds and horn They will go and hunt the "possum," Alfred, John and Mr. Mc, And I think I hear them shouting, H-o-o-p! when Driver's on the track.  "Light the lantern, Leed has treed one, Hear him bark!" they shout with glee, And LeRoy climbs up the Red Oak, Shakes the "possum" from the tree. "Here he is: and he's a big one: Oh what luck! Ah, let me see; Listen, boys, they've treed another, I hear Ponto; hurry he!"  Aloa takes the sack of "possums " (When they've caught some two or three), James will blow the horn for doggies; Here comes Driver, Ponto, Leed. Now they turn their footsteps homeward, Calling grandpa, sleeping sound; "Clean our game tomorrow morning, Grandma, cook them nice and brown."  "How we wished Hagar was with us, But she don't eat "possum" tho', Yet she would enjoy the hunting Of the cunning fellow, so." This is how they spend their Christmas Many, many miles away, In the woods among the blackjacks, Hauling feed, corn, fodder, hay.  Could they hear the Christmas carol, Could they hear the church-bells, then, Could they hear the choir singing, "Peace On Earth Good Will Towards Men", Would they long to leave the country? Would they pine for life afar? Would they give up all their pleasure?  Just to come here where we are? No; they'd rather hunt the "possum," Feed their horses just at dawn, Than to hear the Christmas carol, Than to live in crowded town. 
Of that same swarthy tint and hue, Of tales as thrilling and as true,    A pretty Desdemona He needs but then to tell them to,    To be a happy owner.  Of that same swarthy tint and hue, Of tales as thrilling and as true,    I am the happy owner; But I care not to tell them to A pretty Desdemona;    Some colored maid will do. 
All blessings on thee, Father Time, Thou art the theme of prose and rhyme. Oh, let me now thy praises sing, For Time, thou art a mighty king!  Thy golden scepter sways o'er all, Before thee kingdoms rise and fall; Still never weary on thy way Thou ploddeth on from day to day.  By thy command comes lovely Spring, The flowers bloom and sweet birds sing, And while all nature seems in tune, We see the rosy face of June.  Oh! how delightful is the scene, When earth is all arrayed in green; Bedecked with Summer roses rare, Sweet pinks and waving lilies fair!  Say, Father Time, now pause a while, And let us bask in Summer's smile; And linger 'neath her cooling shade, 'Oh why should Summer roses fade?'  But no! Once more thy scepter sways, And now come on September days; Earth's verdant robe is changed to gold The flowers fade—the year grows old.  Thou moveth on with steady tread, November's snowflakes brush thy head; Around thee blows the chilling blast, And now the old year breathes its last.  Yes, Father Time, thou art a king, And well of thee let poets sing, For thou dost hold a rightful sway, And thy commands we must obey.  The rosy cheek, the sparkling eye, Before thee slowly fade and die The strong man droops, his strength decays, And o'er him pass thy fleeting days.  By thy command loved ones must part The eye grows dim and sad the heart. Then to the soul bowed down with grief, Thy soothing balm brings sure relief.  Still ever on thy ages run, What others dare not, thou hast done. Well might thy praises tune this rhyme, Oh Prince of Rulers, Father Time!  March on! Thou king, March on thy way! Still o'er us let thy scepter sway, And bring us to that golden shore Where friends and loved ones part no more. 
Let me live close to men's hearts. In the years When youth is full, let me know men and grow Into the knowledge of their pulsing souls. Not on some distant height wherein the veil Fame tapers and the siren temples blaze, May my days pass, but on a lower ground, Where men of might brave dubious circumstance, Where sorrow wears the heart, would lose the soul, Where earnest life demands the high ideals.  In lusty labor and the fight with fire, Or sin, unlovable benightedness, May I know men, and knowing learn to love, And loving learn to help them in their toil. 
Rest Lincoln, rest! thy work is done, Thy record is on high. Thy soul,which here communed with God Lives with him in the sky! Thy tomb shall be the shrine to which More pilgrim feet shall turn, Than to Mount Vernon's sacred shades Or Moslem Prophet's Urn!  Rest!while the work by thee begun Shall sweep its widening way And chains and manacles shall burst And crowns and thrones decay! While onward through the ages vast The Freedom song shall swell And earth's millennial morn shall haste Rest, Lincoln, rest! Farewell! 
Earth hath not one trampled mortal Whom an all-wise Maker gave Sense and reason but to foretell Him created a mere slave.  Races differ; but are equal. Since the flight of Time began, Each hath been some other's sequel In the forward march of Man.  Oh, my brothers better favored In this "Land of Liberty," Sorrow all the winds hath flavored 'Cross the gulf 'tween thee and me!  Must the answer be forever To our hopes, as it hath been, "Never, never, never, NEVER"?- Oh, the doleful repeten'!  O my soul, what fears assail it When that chilling word is said!-- "Never!" Oh, the night-winds wail it In their requiem o'er the dead!  "Never"!--foaming waters sob it To the wrecks along the shore:—- "Never"!--All the sad drums throb it. Marching to the battle's roar!  Say it not. Bar not, nor blight us: Send, from summits where ye dwell, Hopes, like torches, that may light us From the labyrinths of hell.  And, my comrade, do not waver, Tho' you be of trampled race, Claim your birth-right, without favor, "Till the world shall give you place.  Rise on visions sent to win you From your languor and duress; By the hope that lives within you, God hath called you to success.  O, if looms Life's mount before you, Towering terrible and vast; Threatening loud to topple o'er you, Muttering warnings of the past;  Do not tremble when you near it, To behold its awful height; Like the eagle, let thy spirit Soar above it, in its flight!   Rills of joy flow down that mountain, Gems of beauty cluster there; Thou canst quaff there of life's fountain, And breathe triumph in the air!  And when thou hast scaled the highest Peak in all that mountain-band, Help the comrade toiling highest Mount it from the table-land.  God is just; and, with his own hand, He will shape our destiny; If our future be in this land, Or in that beyond the sea.  Be it ours to watch and listen; Calmly ours to meditate; Brighter stars will rise and glisten, Tho' their coming seemeth late. 
A rock for ages stern and high, Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky; And never bowed his haughty crest, When angry storms around him prest  Morn springing from the arms of night, Had often bathed his brow with light; And kissed the shadows from his face, With gentle love and tender grace.  Day, pausing at the gates of rest. Smiled on him from the distant west, And from her throne the dark-browed night Threw 'round his path her softest light.  And yet he stood unmoved and proud, Nor love, nor wrath his spirit bowed He bared his brow to every blast, And scorned the tempest as it passed.  One day a tiny, humble seed, The quickest eye would hardly heed Fell trembling at that stern rock's base, And found a lowly hiding-place.  A ray of light and drop of dew Came with a message kind and true They told her of the world so bright, Its love, its joy, and rosy light;  And lured her from her hiding-place, To gaze upon earth's glorious face; So peeping, timid, from the ground, She clasped the ancient rock around;  And climbing up with childish grace She held him with a close embrace Her clinging was a thing of dread, Where'er she touched a fissure spread;  And he who'd breasted many a storm, Stood frowning there, a mangled form; So truth, dropped in the silent earth, May seem a thing of little worth Till, spreading 'round some mighty wrong, It saps its pillars proud and strong. 
Childhood days are golden treasures,    That doth brighten every life, Oh! how precious is their mem❜ry    In the after years of strife.  Childhood paints the sky with wonders;    Fills the air with myriads bright; Finds perfume in ev'ry flower;    Deems the earth a world of light.  Childhood sees not earth's rough places,    But its paths are filled with flowers, In the cloud it sees the rainbow    And forgets the time of showers.  In its realm it knows no falsehood,    On the face sees but the smile, Innocence is its companion,    Fancy doth its hours beguile.  Memory, keep within thy casket,    These fair scenes of childhood bright, And in hours of gloom and sadness,    Bring these visions to my sight.  Like the brilliant hues of sunlight    Doth the clouds with silver line; So through cares and disappointments    These fair visions will entwine! 
Be worthy of the trust that's placed in you, By doing well that which you have to do. Place high the standard of your heart's desire, And let your deeds some other heart inspire.  For whether high or low be your estate Some kindred soul your deeds will emulate; And should you overtake, upon life's road, Some weary pilgrim, bent beneath his load,  Fail not to pause, and help him on his way, For time thus spent, is counted not delav. And when you come to where the paths diverge, Toward the right be sure to urge  All those who fain would go the other way, To follow you, lest they should go astray. And let your voice be that of one who cheers  The lonely heart, and makes it smile through tears  Be tender, patient, generous and true, Lend strength to weaker hands stretched out to you, And when at last the sands of life have run, The consciousness of deeds thus nobly done, Will be the beacon light of Paradise, To guide your spirit safely to the skies.
A perfect work, God made somewhere, I only know that thou art fair. Made of some priceless loom, and dyes He wrought you, flesh and hair and eyes For thou art fill'd with every rare And precious thing of earth, sky, air. The magical blue of warm June skies Gleams in your calm and sultry eyes; The unguent of the fragrant fields No sweeter, subtler perfume yields Than the aroma of your breath, Delicate fragrance attared 'neath The sculptured, firm white beauty of Your neck, arch'd so sweetly above The undulation of your breast Like ocean swells in slow unrest, With such exquisite motions act Like captious, yearning cataract, It seems from some sweet source to swell Full, passionate and musical. I would not praise too much your charms; The curvature of your fair arms; For the hand that modeled you Gave every line respective due. Laborious tho' his task begun. 'Twas pleasure when he viewed you, done. Whatever might his joy have been 'Tis confident he tried again To give you more than sculptured grace In lineaments of form and face. He tuned the strings of soul and sense To notes of soothing elegance; The quintessence of April's dream In varying moods of shade and sheen Tempered the phases of your mind. To fancies changeful as the wind. He gave you joy, the crown of life, Pure metal unalloyed with strife; And just enough of passion, too, To make you madd'ning thro' and thro'. But these mere words do ill supply The color to paint my visioned eye. The blended beauty in you, glows Of lily, violet and rose; The lily, symbol of thy pure Chaste, gracious soul; the lure Of spiritual radiance, which, Shrine you a saint in holy niche; But when endowed with saddened mien Apensive violet you seem, A tender, tearful, yearning child Of fragrant senses, frail and mild. And then, you too can turn to be Agorgeous rose divinity-- Love, life and passion smiling thro' The perfect fullness of your hue! 
Ay, black was the man, and black was the deed, But blacker by far was the lawless creed Of those lawless men with their faces white Who avenged the deed in the dead of night!  For black were the hearts of that howling mob, And worthy of Hades their fiendish job! A shudder of horror around the globe ran, At this beastly revertal of civilized man!  The earth holds no record of more barbarous scene, No wild, savage orgie in history's dark screen Surpasses in demon-like hatred and spite, The deed of those white men that shameful night.  And this, on Columbia's "land of the free!" Beneath the bright flag whose stars all decree A perfect equality, justice; above all Protection by law, until those stars fall!  And this, when we reprimand Russia, in sooth! And prate of our liberty, freedom and truth! The nations of earth point the finger of scorn At Columbia's banner, blood stained and torn!  Shame! shame on the brutes who let loose on the land This Spirit of Lawlessness! 'Twas Southern hand. First took up the fagot, the torch and the stake, And started these fires which 'twill take blood to slake.  Defiant of law, both of man and of heaven, They lynched and they roasted alive! Now this leaven Contagious is working; but God is not blind; They'll reap the wild whirlwind, who sow the wind! 
Ah, sweet, when I am far from you    And I sit, with stars above; 'Cross fallow fields, or rolling blue,    I bid them take my love.  Sit thou within thy garden bower,    And dream that I am true; Each twinkle from the starry shower    Bears messages to you. 
Again is heard the crying of the children in the night, They are praying to the Father to defend their legal right, They are praying him for justice swift against illegal might, Their race is marching on.  These children of the nation now are growing wise and strong, They have suffered long in silence, under selfish Southern wrong, But they know that rank injustice has been meted to them long, Their race is marching on.  Their rights by constitution have been quibbled quite away, The ballot taken from them so they ne'er can have fair play; They're accused and without trial are strung up the selfsame day, But their race is marching on.  It's "lynch 'em, lynch 'em, lynch 'em, there's no law for black men here," "Tar and feather, shoot, and burn 'em, there is nobody to fear;" "This is the white man's country and no niggers wanted near," But their race is marching on.  God's eye doth aye behold them, there's no "color line " on high, His ear is open to them, He hears every sob and cry; He sits in righteous judgment, every soul that sins shall die, Their race is marching on.  The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small, It cost a millions lives or more to make the shackles fall; 'Twill cost a million lives again, the wormwood and the gall, Their race is marching on. 
I.  The highest aims forever live, And reach sublime events, They prophesy and they fulfil, And bring divine contents. Oh, town beside the purple bays, A tale of Lincoln here I bring to thee, in whose events Thine own high aims appear; For grow in life all grand intents. In noble thoughts and deeds, As Servius Tullius' hopes lived on And bloomed at Runnymeade.  II.  He turned away from crystal halls, And bowed himself in prayer, Lincoln, the commoner, beloved; A sergeant waited there. The door swung back; and Lincoln said, "The invader's arm is riven." "Whence comes the news?" the sergeant asked. "The message came from Heaven!" Once over our flag stood still the sun, Three nights were a day, and three days were one, That day was Gettysburg!  This morn to Heaven I raised my voice, "Give us thy power divine, And I the bondsmen's chains will break." Heaven said, "The field is thine." I stood in silence, came the word, "The battle has begun." And on the eastern windows burned The red midsummer sun.  III.  He walked alone the halls of state, Our Lincoln, the beloved; Afar the thunder clouds of fate The serried hilltops moved. But mustering hosts of blue brigades. He saw not, clear nor dim; When forth the mighty columns passed ' Twas history past to him. Once over our flag stood still the sun, Three nights were a day, and three days were one, That day was Gettysburg!  IV.  Another day the heavens rend, Earth's axle bends and sways, On three times fifty thousand men, Two hundred cannon blaze, No soldier knew what night would bring To that uncharted field, To him who sought Heaven's council hall It was alone revealed.  V.  When Pickett's men had cleft the fields, Hills leaped in horror dire, They stood like men with lifted shields, While the gray lava's fire Sunk into ashes, thin and pale, Then swift the heroes formed And all the wavering force assailed That, baffled, force had stormed. Once over our flag stood still the sun, Three nights were a day, and three days were one, That day was Gettysburg!  VI.  The meteor flag that flashed from Heaven, Then lightened in the cloud, And 'neath the skies thrice thunder -riven The Alleghaneys bowed. July the third; the cloud wings reft Revealed again the sun; The skies of Liberty shone clear, And those three days were one.  VII.  Lincoln! To consecrate the field, To Gettysburg he came, As on that morn when earth stood still In Heaven's arrested flame. The blue brigades around him pressed, As they had ever done, And waited for the prophet's word, Ten thousand men as one. Once over our flag stood still the sun, Three nights were a day, and three days were one, That day was Gettysburg!  VIII.  Care-worn, he bent on them his face, The centuries were there, 'Twas thinner than that hour when Heaven Its message sent through prayer. He spake: "The dead have given this spot The glory that is due, That the Republic perish not, Let us to them be true!  IX.  O Gettysburg! O Gettysburg! O day of days sublime, That made new destinies for men And set the clock of time. 'Twas that worn face that summoned Heaven His heroes to enfold, And saw the hosts invisible Like the young king of old.  X.  Helpers invisible there are That prophet souls may know, O'er them night's silver irises Of apperception glow. The earth revolves in spirit zones, And circles spirit spheres, And oft life's choral overtones Are heard by saints and seers, So over our flag stood still the sun, Three nights were a day, and three days were one, That day was Gettysburg.  XI.  On Seminary Ridge increase The fruited fields of fall, And far the Susquehanna gleams Beneath her mountain wall. Peace lifts her white hand in the heaven, Above each turf- ribbed hill Where on the day with thunder riven The sun of fate stood still.  XII.  Such is my tale of Gettysburg, But, Barrington, to thee, An hundred years before, God spake That thou thy bondmen free, And here where Williams breathed the word That conscience throned to rule, Where Myles for liberal knowledge made Each cabin home a school,  XIII.  The silver trump of freedom blew, In life's diviner air, And thence Emancipation grew To power in Lincoln's prayer. From here went freedom on her march That human victories won, Until o'er Gettysburg's grand arch Our Prophet held the sun.  XIV.  O, town beside the purple bays, That build in life's diviner air, To-day we see thy ancient ways, The high creative power of prayer. Thy past has larger dowers to give, To all mankind in word and deed, So Servius Tullius still doth live In memories of Runnymeade.  XV.  To Lincoln's faith at Gettysburg Let us our pledge renew, A Genius noble summons us, Time's work supreme to do. Come, Oh thou Diva, come and bring The gifts the building ages sing, To man his birthright, toil a field, To need a largess true, To each the justice of the state, To all the wealth that they create, To him who toils, his due. So shall we live in gems enscrolled Like those who broke the chains of old. 
I.   O, flower fair, With beauty rare, To be like thee It is my prayer.  II.  To be so pure, My lot endure, Of Heaven, then, I would be sure.  III.  To have thy peace, All trials cease; And from my sins To find release.  IV.   To live like thee So happy, free From sinful life And vanity.  V.  To smile above, Receive the love Of Jesus Christ The heavenly dove.  VI.  But ah, my flower, Within thy bow'r, To be like thee, I have no pow'r. 
Say, can it be you do not know That in the Summer long ago, My friendship into love did grow? Until, sweetheart, I loved you so, That all else in this world beside meant       Naught to me.  Sometimes I feared that you keen eyes Would surely pierce my love's disguise. And end my dream of Paradise With just one look of pained surprise, To know that love now shared the place       Where friendship ought to be.  But now the lesson I must learn,— To quench the fires of love that burn Into my soul, and make it yearn For that which you can ne'er return; For well I know, that just a friend is all        You sought to be. 
I.   The city, Washington, D. C., That day wuz in its glory-- It 'peared like Paradise to me, All beauteous spread before me:  II.  An' arter trampin' heaps an' heaps, I see, to crown my joys, Whar Uncle Sammy Yankee keeps His school fer witty boys.  III  I rapped; Sam opened wide the door; Invited me to come in. Sez he: "In jest a minute more, The boys'll be a-summin."  IV.  So, I goes in, an' takes a seat; Thinks I: "How nice this place An' ain't it promisin' to meet So many bright young faces?"  V.   I see two gents uv learned a'r  A-workin' in the room thar'; S'I: "Uncle Sam, who be them thar?  'Pears like I've seen 'em somewhar'"  VI.  "Them is our lecturers," he sez "Renown men in our nation, The great Professor Prejudice, An' Dr. Degradation."  VII.  S'I: "Whut them tryin' to do?" Sez Sam: "To settle whut they're'n doubt uv, They're cuttin ' up a colored man, To see whut he's made out uv.  VIII.  "The plain fact is, you see, my guest. To-day our lesson figures On workin' out the plan that's best To elevate the niggers.  IX.  "An' soon's we find the difference Between the black an' white men, It's plain to see, by common sense, That things 'll start off right then."  X.  "Yes, I'm convinced," sez Prejudice, "That we'll the line discover We'll strike it pretty soon, I guess; Jest help me roll 'im over."  XI.  They found a heart, a brain, a soul— P—- whispers, pale with wonder, "D—-, ef this is the man we stole, We're snowed completely under!"  XII.  "Lor', look!" sez Degradation," run It's monstrously surprisin ', But, arter all that has been done, The nigger is a- risin'!"  XIII.  An' then, I swan, you orter seen Them thar' two fellers hurry Outen that school-room, lookin' mean An' quarrelin' like ole fury.  XIV.  I watched 'em long, uz they ferlorn, Fur down the road wuz goin'; An' then I woke, an' it wuz morn The roosters wuz a-crowin'.  XV.  You see, I'd been nowhar' at all, Except in bed, a-dreamin', But still, I've let the story fall Jest uz to me 't was seemin'.  XVI.  I never holds no malice 'g'in' No one-one way ner 't other; But still, it shorely ain't no sin To dream an' tell it, brother. 
Weird and eerie violin What spirit strange hast thou within, That from thy seeming empty shell Would man-forbidden secrets tell? What means the medley of their tones, The laughter, wailing, shrieking, groans; Then tender, whispering, sighing strain That sets us dreaming, causing pain And longings fierce for things unknown, For lives wrong spent to make atone; And changing swift to light and gay, With feet-compelling notes that sway And claim us to their revelous mood, Forgetting care with all its brood Of earthly ills that hold and thrall, Alike the portion of us all? Anon from 'neath thy quivering strings A thrilling, vibrant challenge rings, A pure, sublime, inspiring theme, Uplifting, nerving, till we seem With any fate prepared to cope, Through any fate prepared to hope. Weird and eerie violin, What spirits strange hast thou within? 
My heart is torn within me,    And my hair is turning gray, For I've asked her if she'll have me,    And I don't know what she'll say.  The moon lit air was balmy,   And the boat was drifting slow, And she looked so sweet and dainty    In her gown as white as snow,  That before I really knew it,    I had clasped her little hand, Asked her told her how I loved her,    Drew her closer--and--and--  Well, my heart is torn within me    And my hair is turning gray, For I've asked her if she'll have me,    But I hope she'll say me nay. 
Right merrily rings the old church bell, What joy, what joy its music tells, Hark! and you will hear it say Rejoice and be glad, 'tis Christmas day. Rejoice and be glad, 'tis Christmas day. Its merry chimes sound loud and clear, As they peal forth on the frosty air, In triumphant tones, it seems to say Christ was born on Christmas day. Christ was born on Christmas day. Peace on earth, good will to men,— Rings the old church bell again, Peace on earth, good will to men, Christ was born in Bethlehem, Christ was born in Bethlehem, Ding,b  dong, know ye not 'tis Christmas morn! Come one, come all, in answer to my merry call. Come raise your voice in cheerful song, To praise the Lord this Christmas morn, To praise the Lord this Christmas morn. 
Twas on a bright midsummer morn, The sun sent down its hottest ray, And parched the blades of growing corn, And turned the verdant grass to hay, That old Aunt Susan, hat in hand, Rushed into "Squire Tatem's " store; (Twas in Virginia, understand, In those bright days soon aft' the war, When every vote was counted right, When Truth and Justice had the sway, And magistrates were black, not white Before the "New South " had its way ).  "Oh! Br'er Tatem, giv' me quick Er warrant fur Glen Barney's ' ress, Glen beat my gal wid dis yere stick, An' throwed her down an' tored her dress, An' rushed at me wid er big knife, An' chased me 'round de ole hog pen, An' threatened fur ter take my life, So, Br'er Tatem, please ' ress Glen!"  It happened on that very day, The constable, young Frederick Bright, Had called to pass the time away, In talking politics till night; But when he heard Aunt Susan tell Of this wild outlaw's thirst for gore, The brave young fellow's courage fell; He quickly started for the door.  "Come back, young man!" the Justice cried, ("And you go home now, Sister Brown.") The frightened officer replied: "I can't, I've got to go to town." "Come back and serve this warrant, Bright; You must not shirk from duty, Fred. Find Barney if it takes all night, And bring him here alive or dead.  "I'll show that fellow he can't do Just as he please while I'm aroun ' When he's in jail he'll sadly rue The day he threatened Sister Brown." Poor Freddy wished ten times or more He'd stayed at home upon that morn, Instead of coming to the store,- He also wished Glen ne'er was born.  He sadly read the warrant through: "July the 16th, 72, Virginia County, Princess Ann "To Frederick Bright I here command " (Which reads as near as rhyme can tell), "Whereas, One Glenmore Barney fell, Upon one Susan Brown with knife, And threatened he would take her life, And badly beat the plaintiff's daughter, Then threw her down in mud and water, And otherwise did show his hate For all the laws of this good State, That I command you, Frederick Bright, To bring before me, here to-night, The body of the said Glenmore Barney, to be tried by law, With seal affixed, my name you see, Moses Tatem, a J. P.  So Freddy filled his pistols three, And took the handcuffs from the store, Got on his horse with trembling knee, And started out to find Glenmore. (To the warrior it may be Endless glory, as 'tis said, After fighting for the free, To get a bullet in his head.) Still, every sound made Freddy start As on he rode with bated breath. Our hero knew lead in the heart Meant only now a fameless death.  At last he reached the "Taylor Farm" Where wicked Barney's deeds were done. He threw the handcuffs 'cross his arm, And cocked and primed his ready gun. As up he rode before him stood, A pretty maid, with yellow face,  And Fred cried out: "The wretch who would Harm such beauty, doth disgrace The name of man, and is a brute. To drown him would pollute much water, And powder's wasted if I shoot,- For is not this Aunt Susan's daughter?"  "Where is that Glenmore Barney now?" He yelled, (for beauty made him brave ) "Where is the cur, for here I vow To send him to a timely grave!" "My name is Glen - Glendelia, sir," Replied the maid of golden hue, "How dare you class me as a cur?" "What! You Glen Barney! Is it true?"  He looked into her eyes of black, As there he sat on steed of white; Out went his heart; she sent her's back, 'Twas as of yore -love at first sight. 'Twas "Maud" again, and country Judge, Of schoolboy lore and world renown, "Rich repiner and household drudge," Our "Maud" was yellow, our "Judge "was brown.  Law knows not love; love knows not law, Still Fred remembered why he came. So he resolved without a flaw, To do his duty, just the same. "Well, Glen - that is Miss Barney, I Am very sorry it is true, But tell the truth, the reason why I came down here, is after you.  "This morning, old Aunt Susan Brown, Rushed into 'Squire Tatem's store, And had him write this warrant down, Which puts you in the hands of law." Frederick read the warrant through, The maiden listened with a smile. "I beat her daughter, it is true, Because she called me names most vile."  "Then, as my prisoner you must go With me up to the 'Squire's store, Just tell him all the facts you know, And have no fear about the law." With arms akimbo, Miss Glen said, The fire flashing in her eye, "Before I'll go, I'll be shot dead, I will resist until I die.  "What, go to jail for old Aunt Sue, And her old gal, Maria Brown? I will not go for them or you, Nor all the constables in town!" "But Glen, you know the warrant said, (I read it through without a flaw ) That I must take you, live or dead, You know, dear girl, that is the law.  "I'll get a buggy for you, Glen, And drive you with the utmost care, Pray, for my sake, will you go then? You'll come out right, so never fear. Go for my sake, my pretty maid, I vow you'll never go to jail, Oh, trust me, do not be afraid, For I will freely stand your bail."  Glendelia smiled, and so did Bright, And then she said she'd go, but walk. This gave the constable delight, And also gave him time to talk. So ere they reached Judge Tatem's store, The constable a story told, The same old story as of yore, The story that will ne'er grow old.  It only took five minutes ' time Before the learned Justice read: "Glendelia Barney did no crime, When she resented what was said. She only did the things she should, When she was called that wicked name. Why, Sister Brown, I know you would, And so would I, have done the same.  "The case's dismissed, the prisoner's free, This calling names is wicked sport, The plaintiff losing, as you see, Must settle all the costs of court." The constable walked off with Glen, And here we might as well just say Before we throw aside our pen, He married her on Christmas Day. 
If I had a million dollars I don't know what I'd do, But I sometimes think I'd stroll around and squander a few; Or, maybe I'd steel away to the country's quietude And spend the rest of life among the simple and the rude.  I harldy think with the fashionable I'd be imbued, And the society woman I swear I would elude; Nor should the bosoms 'of my Sunday shirts be immaculate- Even a million, I don't think, my cranium would inflate.  Because I'd like to slip a cog. and go it with a bit, With my soul aglow of passion for my brother in the pit ; Proud to be with the commoners, I'd rusticate awhile, Nor would I care a cursed thing about the latest style.  “Brogan shoes and homespun socks?" The very things I need, For too much dress and fashion would my lithe step impede; A single gallus, friend, would hold my breeches on to me, And I'd not care a snap about their bagging at the knee.  The doctrine of the broad-brimmed hat I'm sure I would not heed. I believe in reducing things to what we really need; Besides I've always been content under a brimless cap, To go it with the urchins a-frolicing, jolly chap.  With them I'd like to take just now a little bit of ease, A lounging where I used to, out under the apple trees, A whittling and swapping jokes with Bill and Tom and Ned, And let our mem'ries Ait around the lore of the trundle-bed.  Aye, over and above it all, this is the simple truth: If I'd it, and could, I would spend a million for my youth! Then with my true love I would go a sparking it again, And look the love upon her my tongue could never explain.  To lead her once again, my friend, through the old Virginia reel : To salute her, to balance all; again, to fondly feel The same old bliss I used to while swinging corners all And stepping to the music of the jocund country ball,  Were worth millions of yellow pelf to a maimed old chap like me, And I'd give it, if I could, with a zest of childish glee. Oh! if I could but put away my gout and rhumatis', And take an old-time outing from the pressure of my "biz,"  With a bonny girl and youth I'd go to the fair old sunny clime, Down the sylvan haunts of Dixie, where the jessamines ever twine; Where the lillies faint of sweetness, and ever blows the thyme; Where the seasons all are summer and the climate is sublime !  Where the rose aflame of beauty, drops its petals on the sward, Geraniums blush to scarlet; the passion flowers nod And the breezy sweep of zephyrs brings on the metric chime Of the winged minstrelsy in in the glory of their prime..  If you could take the silver from this old pate of mine, Call back my youth a-gambling down yon vista way sublime, And bring me back my true love, my long-lost love again, Up from among the daisies where she so long hath lain ,  The million dollars you might have and millions o'er and o'er Again I'd take my love and youth and ask for nothing more.
My brother John has a cot of down And a mansion for his home; The humble bed where I rest my head Is little less than a stone; But love is there to soothe my care, And brother John has pride, So I pity him while I revel there, For his is a world of care.   My brother John has a fertile farm Broad fields of cotton and corn, Naught have I but the deep blue sky, Just space to look upon, And a barren spot behind his lot, He assigns to me as home; But I feel for John as I revel there For his is a world of care.  My brother John's lord of a town, While I not a hovel own; Without a home the world I roam, A happier man than John. I know not why that John and I Have drifted so far apart, And I feel for him, my brother there; For his is a world of care.  My brother's hold is fixed on gold, A carriage and horses four; And they draw their load over the paved road With a flash and a dash by the poor. When go I must, I tramp through dust Alone where they have sped, Yet I feel for John as I revel there; For his is a world of care.  My brother John has a splendid lawn, Scythed and rolled and green, A verdured spot of which I'm not Even allowed to dream, To all that pass, “Keep off the grass," Is the order, and I keep on, Yet I envy not for I am happy here On the commons of brother John.
O you who wrote your sounding line On Shakespeare's mighty mind and heart, Before the time of Goethe's art Delivering the sisters nine, What measures can such lips as mine Unto your further fame impart, Within whose soul a song did start, Even when you sank in Omar's wine? With Barabas I count my gold, And delve in murders manifold; With Tamburlaine I rule the world, And then with Faust to hell am hurled; I hear the steady onward tramp Of armies on the battle-plain ; And then I feel the dew and damp, And rest forever with the slain. With you I tramp the London street, And see the good and evil there; With you a demon's curse repeat, Then up to glory I repair; For if there is a heaven to win, Above the ken of mortal eyes, Why wander in the ways of sin, Beyond the pale of Paradise ? I often wonder when I read These tales of vast and vague desire, How happy are those mortals freed From such excess of love and fire, But when I think of this man's state, And all his meeds of joy and pain My rising faith o'er comes my fate, And turns the harp of life again.
Down in the Southland once I found a vale    Wherein I thought the fairy muses dreamed.    Thither so oft I went that soon it seemed My soul, when lonely, sought that quiet dale. So I would go; and, when all else would fail,    Peace met me there, with gentle eyes that streamed    In sympathy; and Hope came; and I deemed That, sheltered safe from every stormy gale,    Dreaming sweet dreams, 'twere sweet to rest me there    Forevermore. And, haply, soine sweet bard Might see my grave, and sing, while cooed the dove,    And breathed the balm of 'fumed air and sward, Of life and death, and mystery, and love;    And all the tender hopes that waft us up above.
Stop! O, Nation, stop and listen! Listen with your heart and brain, Hear the weird Voice of the Negro, Coming up from Southern plain : From the brakes of Louisiana, From the fields of whit’ning grain, From the lees of Mississippi, Listen, as it comes again.  Not for social recognition, Not for alms this Voice is rife. For this, and only this 'tis pleading-- A man's chance in the race of life. For an equal chance to labor, And honest pay for honest toil; Give this, and by the God who made us, We'll win success on Southern soil.   We still have hope, tho' darkness lowers, And tbunders spread their dread alarms; Faith in the best blood of the Southland, Faith in the strength of our own arms, Faith in the truth, tbo’crushed and bleeding; That justice in man's heart still dwells, We'll kiss the rod, then rise and labor, God reigns above, and all is well.
Despair and darkness veils the rugged way    That winds o'er crag and barren plain and moor, Where plods the fearless freedman day by day,    Up to the open door.  Through the wide portals beacons break the gloom    Now shadows flee, the night is almost o'er And in the gloaming dusky freedom loom    With faith, simple and pure.  O, cruel fate that beckons and betrays,    'That shatters hope and fair forebodings dim, All, all seems lost, labor of nights and days,    The door is barred to him.  Exile or alien from far distant shores,    Find a warm welcome wait their wiles or wares, While noble natives languish at the doors,    Denied their honest shares.  Relent, arrogant censors, heed his call,    Nor mock his pains nor mimic his sad plight, Your fate is tempted by his rise or fall    Rather than by your might.  Let then the portals open full and free,    The lustrous light its obscure threshold bare, Merit alone should be the master key,    Let all the worthy share. 
May it not be true as we have heard, Fair was the Princess to all most dear; And each kind thought which lived in a wordReflecting the truth in a heart sincere Blossomed in flowers to fall at her feet. E'en now, as then, the Princess is fair, Ever with blessings she cometh to greet, Daily she's speaking with kindness which e'er Lives in the heart as flowers most sweet. 
A mystic veil seems to divide The present from the past; This mystic veil we push aside, But to behold! Alas!  The ghastly images of deeds Wrought as the passion came, Which stroll the halls of memory, Wrapped up in secret shame.  The curtain drawn again aside Reveals another scene Ambition rules whate'er betide; Which shows what might have been.  Faint voices from the world beyond Of friends we loved so well; Like unto thee, seem to respond- "Vain world, Farewell-Farewell!  The bells ring out in doleful chime Their echo- we can hear; From o'er the silent sea of time,— "Farewell, Departed Year." 
Southward the fleeting sun long since has sped, And from the West the sunset's ruddy glow Gleams with resplendence on the spotless now That hill and house-top, mantle -like, o'erspread. The snow-crown'd serrate peaks, once drear and dead, Luminous ustre lend the glades below, Where the green holly and the mistletoe Supplant the summer's dormant flower -bed. Commingled with the sound of sleighing bells That mock the monotone of wintry hours, Laughter and lay of lovers loudly ring, Reverberating through the distant dells. Ah! who would pine for spring with gladsome flowers Since Cupid dare defy the icy king!
The strife is o'er; the bloody war is done; The bitter night hath faded with a peaceful sun. The roaring cannon at last is still No more it thunders from the vale and hill. The war is done; ah yes, 'tis o'er, 'tis o'er-- The streams of blood shall flow no more.  Ceased hath the parting of husband and wife—- Of son with a mother in the evening of life. Ceased have the tears and the sad good-byes The groans of the wounded, the dying's cries. Ceased hath the bugle's summoning blast; Ah, the black night of slaughter and carnage is past.  March homeward the armies with ranks thinned and worn; With vacancies telling that many shall mourn. Some husband, some father, some son is not there Among the pale numbers the battle did spare. 'Tis many, O many marched off to the fray, That are not marching home with the numbers today.  O the children who'll look for a father in vain! O the sweethearts who'll look for a lover that's slain! O the wives who were happy ere came the great fight, That are heart-broken widows and mourning tonight. O think of the fathers the war's taken away! Just think of the orphans who're hungry to-day!  The strife is o'er; the bloody war is done; And the black night gives way to a peaceful sun-- But there's sorrow and tears that will not cease With the glorious sun of the beautiful Peace. 
Ye who have the vision, ye who know the plan Of the stretch of empire o'er the haunts of man—  Ye who claim dominion far as man can reach, What are these wild doctrines that at home ye teach?  What is this new notion of the lust of laws, Sheltered by your ensign, bargained for your cause?  Farther yet and farther spreads the eagle's wing, Louder yet your triumph bids the heathen sing;  Farther yet and farther do your footsteps go, Each new day a harvest of the seed ye sow.  Ye who now are seeking daily for your need, What is this ye harbor? What is this ye breed?  This new hope of glory, this one great desire, Daily growing fatter 'neath your altar fire?  What are these new statutes legislators make? Strive they old foundations of your code to shake?  What is this proscription, what these brazen bars— What this fearful fact, sirs, of the jim-crow cars?  Whence these gods of fury, at whose feet ye bow, Relics of past ages ruling o'er us now?  One of your strong poets, virile and of sight, Saw the fearful image, piteous in its plight,  Of a man of might, with muffled undertone, Rolling, rolling, rolling up the hill a stone.  All the agitation, all the strife and woe, All the stress and tumult forty years ago,  Left this mighty problem, covering all our land Will ye crush the Negro or for justice stand?  Was it idle speaking, was it platitude, Do we bend the meaning, dim the magnitude  Of the Declaration, which with good intent Said some things most truly were self-evident?  Wherefore all its teachings do ye fail to heed? Wherefore let ye folly wreck that noble creed?  Life is still unchanging; what ye craved for then Craveth still the heart-throbs of a million men;  All ye fain would teach us by a sterner hand, Do our minds beclouded fail to understand?  Ye who have the vision, ye who know the way, Hear the mighty millions, singing as they pray  Heed the word the dubious present prophesies List the music-making as the toilers rise,  Toiling with their faces turned upon the sun, Rising yet more Godward when the day is done.  Ye who have the vision of the mighty hand, Will ye crush the Negro or for justice stand?  Ye who have the gospel, ye who know the law, Worship ye the night or what your fathers saw? 
There was a time when Socrates The wisdom of the young men drew, When not such leaden forms as these I see, were what the people knew; But now the light the fathers burned By other lights is overturned.  And now the Doric numbers flow More slowly than in elder days; And some less ancient Cicero Now thunders forth in blame or praise; To other gods than Zeus we throng, For Homer in a worn-out song.  And now a people with a zeal For things that they can make and see, Forgets the lyric trance to feel, Hears but the anvil's clank and plea; And now the heart's most sacred tone Is sacrifice to wood and stone.  The leaders of the nations strive, But strive with water, air and fire; And day by day they onward drive Their sons, made mad by mad desire; Yet as their phantoms they pursue, I wonder if the gains are true.  Let me upon Olympus steep Hold forth my unimpeded way; There may I not forget to keep The mystery of yesterday; The life we live is more than meat; Beware the creeds your lips repeat! 
I will not cease searching For places unknown, I will not cease hoping To kneel at the Throne; But on through the darkness Of trouble and care I go daily praying To find comfort there.  I will not cease toiling As days come and go, I will not cease trying To conquer the foe, 'Til my frail body weakens And sinks to the sod And my soul is uplifted To anchor with God.  
I said a thoughtless word one day, A loved one heard, and went away; I cried: "Forgive me, I was blind; I would not wound or be unkind." I waited long, but all in vain, To win my loved one back again. Too late, alas! to weep and pray, Death came; my loved one passed away. Then, what a bitter fate was mine; No långuage could my grief define. Tears of regret could not unsay The thoughtless word I spoke that day.
I stand upon the vaunted plain    Of many a vanished year, And ever o'er the gloomy waste    Strangely sad voices I hear. Voices from out the shadowed past,    And one I call Regret, And one, I know, is Misspent Hours,    Whose memories linger yet.  Then Failure speaks in bitter tones,    And Grief with all its woes : Remorse, whose deep and cruel stings    My painful thonghts disclose. Thus do tuese voices speak to me,    And flit like shadows past;-- My spirit falters in despair    And tears flow thick and fast.  But when within the wide domain    Of many a future year I stand, from o'er its sunlit plain    A sweeter voice I hear, Which bids me leave the darkened past,    Whence voices call to me And hark! I will obey the voice    Of Opportunity!
Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee. And for Thy mercy, Lord, I plead Continually. Let Thy salvation come Even unto me. Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee.  Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee. And Oh, forsake me not, dear Lord, Full utterly. Thou art my Shield and Hiding Place, And unto Thee I flee. Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee.  Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee. Bestow on me Thy gracious love, Bountifully. My soul seeks Thy salvation yet, When wilt Thou comfort me? Out of the depths, O Lord, I call to Thee. 
Dar's many t'ings dat's done been changed sence de yankees fit an' died: De black man's heart ain't jes' de same, His mouf don't stretch so wide.  I often wondahs will dey come, Dem good ol' days I love I long ter see 'em heah below Befo' I goes above.  Dar, wa'n't no talk in dem ol' days 'Bout two kinds of edication: H'm! All we knowed wuz how ter pray An' work de ol' plantation!  De li'l' brats waz glad ter play Aroun' deir mammy's knees, But now dey runs about de streets An' does jes' ez dey please.  An' me an' Sue done notice how, W'en we's a-gwine ter meetin', De w'ite folks dey jes' pass on by Widout one friendly greetin'.  I 'spec's de mules dey feels de change, Sence de days dat's done gone by: Dar's sorrer in deir mou'nful looks, An' now dey don't kick so high.  It may be we has 'vantages Ouah daddies nevah saw But I jes' longs fer dem ol' days--- De days befo' de wah! 
O, rapturous dreamer! O, singer divine! With passionate ardor thy sweet song thrills, And the bitter-sweet pain of each musical line But heightens the bliss which my being fills.  Ravished with rapture, submerged with delight, And drunk with the excess of passion's red wine, My soul soars aloft to far Ecstacy's height, O, rapturous dreamer! O, singer divine!
Our President who art in Washington, Roosevelt be thy name; You are the man for the colored party, Judge Parker ain't the blame.  Give us this day our daily bread Like you gave to Booker T.; And forgive the Southerners for what they said, For you are the man for me.  Lead us not into social equality, A social right defend; Then we can support a rightful party, As other national men.  You are the choice without despair, The people will defend Your title right to the President's Chair Forever and forever, Amen.
Stream of Time, each wavelet year    Shall lose its own in thee, From source unknown to disappear    In vales of mystery. Though vast and deep they move along ,    Thy waters be not glum ; For, list ! they chant a murmured song    Of years that are to come.  O years that are to come, I know    Not what ye hide from me, In thy dark waters, as they flow    Into eternity; What joy commingles with the tears.    That fleck thy veiling foam , O far, dim, mystic , silent years    Long years which are to come.  O years, the years that passed, we may    Behold them wind along Thro ' Memory's pleasant , shady way ,    And list their low, sweet song; But ye, still years , so gently steal    Us hence and bear us home, We scarce the languid current feel,    O years that are to come.  Majestic river, deep in thee    Embosomed secrets hide , That ne'er shall reach humanity –    Save with thy moving tide. The magic of their beauty shall    Make poets of the dumb When faltered songs, like mine, must fail    In years that are to come.  How sweet thy mellow song shall be,    When thou hast lulled asleep The discords of humanity    That make thee sob and weep . The music of thy moving then    Will thrill the hearts of some; For Peace shall walk the earth again,    In years that are to come.  O vestal waters robed in haze!    O mirrored, tranquil tide! On thy enchanted course I gaze,    As on thy ripples glide; Tho ' in the dark depth pictures gleam ,    I hear a voice speak low: "You dream, but, ah ! were Life a dream,    Time's waters would not flow."  Flow, O thou stream incessant flow .    Nor reck ' if in thy wave The leaves of sorrow fall like snow ,    And storms around may rave . The storms that fret thy bosom wide    Must in the distance cease ; And leaves in thy resistless tide    Shall be submerged in peace.  O years that still shall roll along,    When I am silent clay, If, 'chance, ye find this faltering song,    Do with it as ye may;. But, sweetly as the morning bright    Dispels the shrouding gloom, Turn thy dark features to the light,    O years that are to come.
I.  Upon a flatboat, floating with the tide Ofa great river, a young boatman stands, Lofty of brow; great-hearted; in his hands An oar to steer his craft. On either side Of the broad river, sees he, stretching wide, The waving corn fields and the cotton lands Where slaves toil in the sun. One whose commands They do, rides, whip in hand, with brutal pride, And smites, with bloody, lacerating rod, Their naked backs 'till crimson shows. "Oh, God!" Cries the tall woodsman," if thou hast a plan To free these bondmen, hath the earth a son To execute it, Father---even one?" God's angel whispered: "Aye! thou art the man."  II  In after years a mighty statesman stood Where two roads parted, pondering the way. Over one road the seeming light of day Streamed; dark the next road looked, and little good.--- The roads were Self and Human Brotherhood. Self wound thro' scenes of glory, bright and gay, While Brotherhood's high lights seemed ashen gray. He might have chosen as a mortal would, But for a vision sent him from above: Again he heard the bondmen's wailing cry In white fields stretching by a river dim; Again God's angel came to plead with him. Knowing it meant, perchance, that he must die, He turned from Self to Brotherhood and Love. 
A face of dreams and roses Pleads tenderly with me-  A sweet face that reposes In death, so silently Thro' the deep gloom, she seeks my room, From o'er the Sunset Sea.                         Alas! The silent and mystic sea!   A face of dreams and roses, Dainty as the woodlawns be, Where every stream that flows is A fairy rhapsody Tinkling o'er rocks where sylvan flocks Feed softly, tenderly.                         My love, So softly, tenderly.  A face of dreams and roses Calm as an evening star, Which, when the long day closes, Shines holy, faint, and far O'er lonely leas, and moonlit seas, And coves where the fairies are,                         My dear, Where the beautiful fairies are  A memory, scattering roses, She comes, from Dreamland blown-  I dream, and my soul reposes Entranced on her fairy throne; And-roses - roses - roses Drift on the moonlight, down.                         O, Love! On silvery moonlight, down.  O roses, gentle roses, Ye die so soon, so soon! Some live 'til summer closes, But mine were plucked in June; And life grew drear as the sea -hills sere That gloom to the rising moon.                         Ah, me! To the dripping, and wan-faced moon!  And I think when memory closes Her weary eyes, a-tire, To dream o'er her pale, dead roses, Mid murmurings sad and dire, How my Love lay dead; and my soul, from red, Glows white in pain's altar -fire.                         My soul Glows white in pain's altar -fire! 
I have suffered from the measles, the whooping -cough and mumps; I've had the scarlet fever, I've had the "doleful dumps "; I've had a mule to kick me 'till a thousand stars I've seen, But the greatest pain I've suffered was from apples that were green.  I've had a goat to take my only shirt from off the line, I've seen a fellow walk away with the girl I thought was mine; I've even burst my pantaloons where all the world could see, But the eating of green apples gave severer pains to me.  First I'd hear a mighty rumbling as of thunder far away, And then a fearful gripping like wild demons at their play, And then I'd bend double and just know I had to die, And would see myself just flying through the mansions in the sky.  Mother'd give me paregoric, or a dose of "Number Six," Just a little more pain killer and I sho ' was in a fix; And then I'd swear I had enough, no more of them for me, But next season always found me at that same green apple tree.  But now I've grown to manhood, and apples that are green No more have power to tempt me, now their misery I have seen; But there are other apples I still must learn to shun, Tho' beautiful and tempting, there is death in every one. 
I do not ask, O Lord, in this short life, In some sequestered, quiet nook to dwell; Fain would I seek the battle's fiercest strife; If Thou art near, I know that all is well.  I do not ask, O Lord, that Thou wouldst keep My soul in heavenly pastures green and fair; I pray for strength to comfort those who weep Beneath a weary load of grief and care.  For perfect ease, O Lord, I do not ask; Dost Thou not know Thy weak child's need of rest? Give but the strength for each day with its task, And peace at even on Thy loving breast!
Like winter's drifted snowflakes hoar That tossed in old sleigh bells, The dainty flakes of cotton white Are rocking in tawny shells.  There's music in the snowy lint Strains that the bondmen sang; The doleful notes of the black man's grief That once through the cotton-fields rang.  The melodies echo at the morn A medley of bliss and woe When Southern breezes are astir And through the white fields blow.  Ah, innocent plant of cotton white, Stretching from shore to shore, Though thou didst give our kinsmen Thou art the King, as of yore!
Brothah Johnson, I'se been lis'nin' At yo' preachin' in dis town, And fur Goodniss' sake I tell you You mus' turn yo' preachin' 'roun '.  'Pears to me dat you ain't 'quaintid Wid de t'ings we uns like; Ef you wuz, I tell you, brothah, Quite a dif'ent note you'd strike.  Ain't I hyeahed you say in meetin' Dat ol' torment's b'ilin' hot, An' dah ain't no place fur skatin' Whar de worm dieth not?  Well, I tell you now we black folks Is all dead in love wid fiah, An' de warmes' sorter weathah Is de kind we all desiah.  An' you oughtah know, my brothah, Ef you wants to save a soul, You mus' tell 'em in yo' preachin' Dat ol' hell is mighty col'! 
When you pull the trigger you've made your last play; Hold on and your luck might change In a moment your night may be turned to day, In a manner as sudden as strange.  'Tis cowardly boys to throw down your hand When you may not be pleased with the deal; Play it out to the end and perhaps your stand May some brilliant surprises reveal.  Full many a lad in the game of life Has found it even so; When tired and worn with the heat and strife, And ready to cash in and go;  That he needed only to hold his breath, And wait but a little while, To see the clouds which boded death Break forth in a glorious smile;  While others with chances as good as his Lost Faith and Hope and Heart, And by way of the gun went down with a whiz Went down with a maddening start.  'Tis cowardly, boys, to quit the game, Let Fortune be foul or fair; Play it out to the end, and perhaps your name May shine in the mansions up there! 
You kin talk about yo ' dinnahs Dat you think so rich an' gran ', An' yo ' eatin' things in cou'ses While dah's music by de ban '; But I tell you d'ain't no cookin' Like de cookin ' usetah be In de good ol' days uv slav'ry 'Fo' de darkies wuz set free.  Yas; it's true -yo' stoves an' ranges Gives a monst'ous lot er heat, But I'se one dat's hyeah to tell you Dey cooks nothin' fit to eat; Why, dey ain't a huckle -berry To de open fiahplace, Whar ol' mammy done de cookin' Jes' to suit de fines' tas'e.  We had ash-cake, an' had hoe-cake; We had 'taters an ' punkin pie; We had 'possum baked in gravy, An' we sho wuz livin ' high! We had cabbage an' fat bac'n, We had hoppin' John's and sich, An' dah ain't no use in talkin' Things wuz cooked to suit Miss Mitch!  Den we had de best er health, too, In dem plain an' happy days, W'en we stood so close to Natur' Dat we follahed Natur's ways. All dese aches an' pains an' doctahs Dat has sprung up ev'ywhar Would be all as dead as Hectah Ef we cooked like 'fo' de war.  Go 'long, braggin' 'bout yo' dinnahs Dat you say is rich an' gran', An' yo' eatin' things in cou'ses While dah's music by de ban'; But I'se sho d'ain't no cookin' Like de cookin' usetah be In de good ol' days uv slav'ry 'Fo' de darkies wuz set free. 
Fierce through the windows the red flame broke, And dark and high rose the cloud of smoke.  Fearless the firemen fought the flame, As leaping and dancing full onward it came.  By and by from the building a cry rent the air, And the crowd saw a maid through the lurid glare.  "To the rescue!" cried the captain brave, "Who'll volunteer the woman to save?"  Quick as a flash six men made a rush Straight for the building-and then came a hush.  E'en strong men whispered with bated breath, As they said to each other, "They're gone to their death!"  But in a few moments they hallooed and cheered, For a man with a maid on his shoulders appeared.  They married -- the fireman bold and the dame That bravely he snatched from the maw of the flame;  And oft while she's asleep in their little bed, The wife that he saved from the flame so red,  The man wakes and rolls, and he says with each turn, "Oh, Lord! how I wish I had let her burn!" 
De driftin' snow done lef' de groun'— I's glad it couldn't stay; De welcome sun is in de sky, An' spring is on de way.  'Fo long de bull-frawg in de pawn Gwi' soun ' his sunset strain, An ' den we's gwi' be trampin' roun' In Ap'ul mud and rain.
Dah's music 'nuff to go aroun', An ' all kin sing who will. De spring -bird sendin' fo'th his soun', An' vi'lets peepin 'f'um de groun', Dey all-dey all is duty boun' Yo' cup er joy to fill.  Uv cou'se, sometimes, we's 'bliged to sigh, But all kin sing who will. De sorrers an' de griefs dat fly Ez thick ez blackbirds in de rye, Dey all is gwi' make by -an'-by De joy more sweetah still.  De darkes' night er brightes' day, Yas, all kin sing who will. De shadders dat in de valleys stray, An' make de worl' no longer gay, Dey all is soon gwi' run away, 'Cause sunshine's on de hill. 
Who has never once been tempted Never can be truly strong; Only those who fight the battle Know to sing the Victor's song.  Who by fire has not been tested Nor his strength nor weakness knows; Only through the flames of evil Unalloyed Virtue glows.  Man is never nearer heaven, Never breathes a purer air, Than when, beating back temptation, He resist's the Tempter's snare.  Who has never once been tempted Cannot have the strength of ten, For the scarred and wounded only Are true Virtue's full-grown men.

But de chillun, one by one, jes ' strayed away, An' dey promused dey wuz comin ' bac' some day; Yet dey nevah writ a line Fer ter ease deir mammy's min', An' I 'spec's dey's long sence laid beneaf de clay.

Each cotton row As white as snow, The cotton is ready for picking; Come swing your sack Across your back, The cotton is ready for picking.  See, all around, The bolls abound, The cotton is ready for picking; They open stand On every hand, The cotton is ready for picking.  Merrily sing, Let laughter ring, The cotton is ready for picking; For all are glad, And none is sad, The cotton is ready for picking.  At break of day, Tothe fields away, The cotton is ready for picking; And sleep at night With new delight, The cotton is ready for picking.

Night--The Hypnotist  Again old night has pitched her airy tent, And holds her hands outstretched high over all; Her subjects nodding give at last consent, And march along in Slumber's silent hall.  On Reflection  The dust of by-gone days Few can shake, Without discerning by the way A grave mistake. 
Gone are the roses that blossomed While the withered buds remain, Greedily hugging their sweetness Till the very thought gives pain.  Gone are the souls that blossomed, While the withered buds remain Eagerly grasping life's blessings, Nor giving them back again.  What to the world is the flower That fills not the air with its scent? What to the world is the creature Whose life for himself is spent? 
His silken web the spider spun  While all the earth was wrapped in sleep, Then silently the glowing sun Up o'er the eastern hills did creep; And men did marvel at the shining threads As looked they forth from out their easy beds.  His gems of thought the poet spun While all the earth was wrapped in sleep, And when next morn the glowing sun Shone on the hills and the valleys deep; Ah! men did marvel and praise his name, And did send aloft his work on wings of fame. 
Aeolus  holds in his sombre cave The myriad winds that roar and wave; The clouds, those fire-screens of the sun, Have melted gently one by one As if to hide their forms in haze From the weary toiler's wrathful gaze.  The cricket sings his stinging lay,  The traveller by the dusty way Sits 'neath kind Nature's awning green And looks around with sluggish mein, While through the heated, dazzling air The dinner bell announces fare. 
O my, dat sun   Jes cooked me done, De air so clos' Done did his mos' To smudder us Widout afuss Doan' yo' t'ink it's gwine t'rain?

I'm gettin 'ta'd, De wo'k so ha'd; Please Mistah Rain Do cum again 'K'ase we so so' Kain't do no mo'--- Doan' yo' t'ink it's gwine t'rain? 
There's a joy in every breeze  At Christmas time, As it sings about the eaves At Christmas time. When the heart is light and gay, All our troubles melt away, And sunshine comes home to stay At Christmas time.  In the crackling of the fire At Christmas time, Which has formerly meant ire No thought of rhyme Now we find in perfect feet Rhyme and rythm all complete, Loving verse our hearts to greet At Christmas time.  the falling of the snow At Christmas time, Lies a lesson we should know At Christmas time, As the dark earth high and low Vanishes beneath the snow, Let us banish sin and woe At Christmas time. 
She is a graceful artist, And with artists she keeps apace, For daily does she practice On her bewitching face.
Oft has my heart been prey unto despair; Oft have my tired hands dropped from the rope; But he, I know, who'd reach the purer air Must pull and pull and pull-and firmly hope.
They brought me, tempting - red, Life's richest wine, The mad thirst four hundred years did create, My soul was maddened with desire to sate, At one draught, deep-drawn, vital and divine; I lifted with passionate haste and nigh, The Cup of Knowledge to my famished lips, Like hungry flames unchecked in stubble dry, Athrough my veins red riot to the tips. The æons that my soul, like smothered flames, Burned with fierce ardor wild and was restrained, My soul in silence cherished mighty aims, And longed to tread in fields then unattained; At last enfreed I stood in manhood's peace Full conscious of my soul's divine release.
Nay, once I have not seen the sea, nor know, By long familiar ear, her varying mood, And passionate swell , but here upon this rood, I found this gypsy bard of hers and, lo! Close -fitted to my ear, in gratitude, It murmurs of its far-off parent flow. O, wander Sprite! what Viking fortitude Left thee, stranded waif, achance wind's blow? I am a Shell, far from my native shore; Unlike thee, gypsy bard, my long exile Has made my native speech remembered vain; Here self-communing thou and conning o'er With insane ecstacy thy ancient style, The while another's tongue relates my pain.
The silence of night is abroad and far, The Earth, empty of summer's song-filled hours, Is quiet grown, tho' in her desert bowers, Now deeply still, the querulous crickets mar The silvery stilliness of moon and star; Anear me, grieve the fading form of flowers, The leafless trees despoiled of summer's dowers, And black the fields with winter's blighting scar The world seems dead as unfulfilled desires; No touch is felt of that warm Spirit Birth, Which from the seed awaking reaspires, And makes Life victor in the realms of Death; But still I know beneath the death-won blade Spring's eviternal hopes are deeply laid. 
Like vast nebulæ spinning into space Scintillant worlds of light, his fine spun dreams Are nebulæ of thought; no failure seems To daunt him nor despair; but calm the face He shows the world; if once he wept, no trace Of tears appears; but still about him gleams With loftiness of soul, a light that streams Across our meaner paths and sordid place; Like one who walks in mist or dusk is blurred, He fares among mankind with lofty brow, And half of what he dreams is true and wise, Tho' indistinct and dim, like music heard In sleep; but seldom does our faith allow The wisdom of his clearer, subtler eyes. 
Ah, Gentle One! with patient eyes, I've waited long to catch one gleam Of that fair morn of hazeless skies, When we might stray afield and dream.  To wander free beyond the line, Where town and country, failing, meet, Till far behind us fail and pine, The long lights of the narrow street.  So oft when morn from dewy bed Arose with rosy cheeks aglow, Within my heart of Love I said: "There lifts the day my eyes would know."  Awhile on crag and peak, a light Would burn, and flood the gentle slope, And ere my heart could catch delight, That dawn, at birth, had died like Hope.  One morn, when at my vigils I, You came with subtle eyes to plead, When hopes have failed and dark the sky To grant Love's words a better meed.  Your words are soft and soothing, Sweet; In my dark heart beget was born, At Love's birth-hour, with twilight fleet, That longed-for, higher-lifting Morn. 
Safe by my study fire Wrapped in the peace of dreams Time, like an ashen pyre, Burns down to fits and gleams.  Wrought in the ashen heap, Magic or fairy-made, Strange-meaning figures peep With large eyes unafraid .  "What was the last page read, There where I made a pause? Greece with her arts has lead Rome with her civic laws.  "Let me reflect on this--- What is the Truth to heed Law is a social bliss, Art is a higher need.  Strange how that fire doth hiss! What be these Imps I ken Tragic, grotesque, amiss Far from the forms of men?  "Look how their faces writhe! Hideous, black and severe, Impish old men and blithe, Comic of manners, leer.  "Avaunt! this is not Art Fashioning impish old forms' Greece is gift of the heart, Rome of glory of arms.  Greece of story and song, Home of blind Homer's lyre, Rome of conquering wrong: Caesar's Eagles afire.  Lechery, forum, mart Spell out the Roman life; All of her song and art Throve in the seethe of strife.  Greek of Apollo's Greece Strove with the gods of song, Basked in the smiles of Peace Far from the clash of Wrong.  How many golden names  Leap to the tongue for birth! Half that the World's-need claims Drew from her Mother-earth.  Peace! Art! kindred in time Laurelled the Grecian brow---  Ye who seethe in the slime: Such is the judgment now!  Galley and slave for Rome, Beat by the might of power, Borne to the Captor's home, Foil to his triumph's hour.  But, see! there in the ash, Transfigured by red brands, No longer Imps abash But men, with human hands,  With human Souls, arise; Men, fellow-souls of mine, With kindly human eyes Beseech a friendly line.  "The Ages-past my will  I thought oblivious years, Here rise to haunt me still With goblin shapes and fears.  "Alas! I've lived in vain, Beyond the present hour With hunger for a pain Of high creative dower.  "Greece! Rome! what have I learned  From thine imperious pride?  When such as these have yearned, Unsolaced lived and died.  "The Past, a Banquet Ghost, Comes back to haunt me dread; When we have wished it most, Then least the years are dead." 
Whether I travel by land or by sea, There is a face that is ever with me; By night or by day we are never apart, For ever his image looms large in my heart! 
Eyes like the violet -- in them I see All that is fair, that is holy to me! Eyes that shed fragrance, so constant, so true, Pure as a clear drop of morning dew.  Eyes like the violet, gently along Lead me to vespers -- to prayer and to song. Eyes like the violet, let me I pray Live within range of thy glances all day!
No pleasing speech nor prophet's gift, Nor worldly learning, though profound, Nor yet e'en faith, that mountains lift From their deep seats where doth abound A thousand thousand treasures rare, To heights where worlds in tuneful strain Adore their Maker's might and care, While angels join the glad refrain Can make me but the vilest dust In His clear sight in whom I trust.  Though to the poor I give my all Of land and gold in richest store, Aud - though, if such a fate befall, I yield my body, as before Did Latimer unto the flame, I yet must be the merest dross, With every weight of ancient blame: E'en vain for me must be the cross. Unless from hallowed heights above My soul is charged with sacred love.  For prophecies shall one day fail, And silv'ry speech be silent all; And Time shall Wisdom's fort assail And bid her boastful ramparts fall; And we who, childlike, on the shore Find pleasing pebbles here and there, While seas of truth stretch out before Us unexplored and richly rare;— All these and we shall pass away, But Love shall have an endless day. 
Two stood at the bend of the road one day; One day in the blossoming Spring, One blushing while giving her heart away, One sealing his love with a ring. In the Spring with its loves and its whisperings, In the Spring with its doves of the burnished wings, Sing ho! for the loves of the Spring. One stood at the bend of the road one day And bowed in the wintry blast, Long enough to unburden her heart and pray As she thought of the loving past. Thank God for the love of life's opening days That lifts us above all life's gloomy ways, And thank God for the love at the last. 
What is de song de cool rain sings  As de day begins to break? "Li'l chillun sleep on, hits too soon ter rise, You kin close ergin dem sleepy eyes, Tu'n ovah an' git er li'l mo' sleep, De sun's white rays jes' begin ter peep,— Jes' a li'l mo' slumbah take."  What is de song de cool rain sings In de midst of de long hot day? "You cattle lay down undah drippin' trees, Come undah de bushes you birds an' bees, You flowahs kin lift up yo ' droopin ' heads, You breezes blow soft whah de wild beast treads Oh, Man, you rejoice on yo' way."  What is de song de cool rain sings In de night when de warm win' blows? "You toilahs who dwells on de face of de earth, Fergit all de day wid its woes or its mirth, Lay aside all yo' thoughts of de days to be In dreamlan' f'om strivin' an' toil be free An' trust all to Him who knows." 
The clouds descend and darken, Wild blows the gale and cold; The trees to the storm blasts hearken Standing as sentries bold. Their proud heads gently shifting Paint pictures upon the sky, And snow through the branches sifting God's earth to beautify.  From caves in distant mountains, The wild winds rushing come; They still the voice of the fountains, And hush the brooklet's hum. The frost on windows sketching, Thousands of forms unknown, And far o'er the woodlands stretching Jewels like chaff are strown.  A light thro the storm peeps under-  'Tis Old Sol's charioteer Rifting the clouds asunder, Which dreamlike disappear. And Winter, hoar rejoices Girding his armor fast, While the winds with a thousand voices Answer his stormy blast. 
I hear a happy little song, That comes up from the earth; 'Tis voices of the waking seed That gives the flowers birth.  Another little song I hear, That comes from heaven's blue; It is the carol of teh birds, Bidding the frost adieu.  The brook that gambols down the dell Ripples a merry song--- Amillion sunbeams dance and play' Its quiet path along.  Athwart the skyfloat fleecy clouds, Like swallows on the wing, And soft winds with sweet melodies Caress the infant Spring. 
Flowers are blooming everywhere,    Little maid; Making sweet the balmy air,    Little maid, Gather them from day to day, Loving lessons they convey, And they will not always stay    Little maid.  In each bud a precept taught,    Little maid, Of a haven to be sought,    Little maid, Of the greatness of the one Who doth guide from sun to sun, Who rewards for duty done,    Little maid.     Make thy life so pure and sweet    Little maid, Beautiful, entire, complete,    Little maid; That the King who rules above Shall behold in boundless love, Thee as spotless as a dove,    Little maid.
The eye beholds the flowers in storied beauty, That Nature's floor bedeck in royal state; In every one a lesson taught of duty, Or glory to the world they dedicate.  Beside the laughing brook in meadow straying, They breathe their perfume on the passing air: Their voiceless lips in silence are but saying To Him that gave them birth a constant prayer.  Not within halls alone, where arch and column Attest the feebleness of mortal hand, But in that fane, most catholic and solemn, A temple free, that God himself has planned.  They bloom in God's cathedral, vast and holy, Kissed by the sun by day, the moon by night; Where winds are ever singing softly, slowly. They greet the worshiper with faces bright.  Were I perchance in distant lands remaining, Far from the voice of every priest divine, In company with flowers of His ordaining, I should find peace with them, both priest and shrine. 
The shades of evening round my door are falling, The last bright beams of sunlight fade away; The nightingale his sad, sweet song is singing, And darkness holds the place once held by day.  Thus while I sit Dame Fancy steals upon me, And points my mem'ry heavenward toward the sky; Methinks my soul is drifting onward, onward, Far, far beyond this world to realms on high.  Then Spirits come and fill my soul with gladness, I sit in company with sires of old; They tell me of a brighter future for me, And bid me press in patience to the goal.  I drift, methinks, adown the stream of Fancy, And view the pleasures of another sphere. When shall I find that bliss beyond all measure, And leave behind this old, sad dwelling here?  With joy untold I see a throng, upspringing, In spotless white around a dazzling throne; They sing high praises to a Gracious Father, Who welcomes home his ransomed ones, his own.  No sorrow, pain nor death that home can enter, Where all is joy and peace forevermore; Ever they toil in sorrow while earth-ridden, But win the victory on the other shore.  I view the dark, dark river by mortals dreaded, From which they shrink away they draw near. Ah, would they could know that joy alone awaits them When the Grim Boatman rows them from this sphere. 
Tis sultry noon; The warm and lazy winds blow o'er the plain, Bearing the perfume of the flowers that soon Are sought in vain.  The scene is still; Save the faint whisper of the leaves all day Rocked gently by the wind on dale and hill They dance and play.  When morn is here The myriad voices of the wood are heard; And belts of every hue, so bright and clear, The heavens gird.  The partridge sends Throughout the quiet fields his flute like score, Beside the hedge and where the golden billow blends The wheat fields o'er.  Beside the pond The lilies lift their heads to meet the sun, And wait to greet the sister stars beyond, When day is done.  'Tis Life's high tide The landscape glows with rich and beauteous light, And Nature spreads her "cloth of gold" to hide The earth from sight.
I look today From out the windows of this earthly home, And catch a vista of the destined way Of life that is to be. Awhile I roam Amid the scenes of sorrow and delight, Till death shall come and o'er this frame hold sway And give me vaster sight.                          Ah, who should fear To pass the portals to the higher plane; For life was not begun upon this sphere; 'Tis but a school that fits the soul to gain A home immortal and completes the chain That links us to the ones we love so dear. I know not where our lost ones roam today Within His vaulted realms of high ascent; I only know that somewhere, far away, Is ever peace and rest --- I am content. And Hope is hov'ring with the promise sweet That sometime, somewhere, we again shall meet. 
Blow gently, breezes, the old year is waning, Is ebbing, is drifting, and soon will be gone; The ripening fruit all its fragrance is draining, To mellow the air as the days hurry on.    Sing, zephyrs, sing       Your doleful music bring, While the autumn leaves are reddening.  Blow gently, breezes, the flowers are going, No more brightly glowing their faces are seen Save the gold of the aster and the golden-rod blowing And lifting their heads in the dull fadden green.    Sing, zephyrs, sing       Your doleful music bring, For the autumn leaves are reddening.  Blow gently, breezes, the birds are all flying, Are all swiftly flying where blue is the sky; Forsaking their nests, for the leaves all are dying That nightly have sung them their soft lullaby.    Sing, zephyrs, sing,       Your doleful music bring All the autumn leaves are reddening. 
There is a stillness in the voice of song,- The feathered creatures from the trees have fled; Within the dells the autumn leaves lie dead, And rustle in the breeze -a countless throng. The little brook creeps sullenly along, Within the path that it so lately sped, In laughter o'er the pebbles in its bed. Deep in my heart there steals a thought of wrong Since all this beauty soon must fade away, Forgetting that the Maker's will is right;- Across the landscape all the autumn day Fly cloudy shadows swift as eagles' flight; Soon fades the beauteous sight of Summer's sheen, Soon Winter calls unwelcomed and unseen.
Slowly the dawn is passing, slowly the daylight breaks, Over the frozen landscape, drowsily life awakes;    Chirping his note in merry glee    The snow bird flits from tree to tree.  Over the dome of heaven stretches a cloak of gray Veiling from longing vision, the lordly king of day;    Rising he paints a glowing red    Around the lofty mountain's head.  Fiercely the winds are calling, swiftly they race in glee Bursting the chains that bound them, gladly they wander free;    The barren trees that toss and groan    Remurmur to the winds' low moan.  Falling with downy softness, down comes the fleecy snow Silently as our blessings scattering to and fro,    Peeping without with faces bright    We see the earth in shroud of white.  Soon will the day be dying, and merry sleigh bells ring, Making the young hearts happy, gladness and mirth they bring.    Fain would I glide along with thee    O youthful sleighers blithe and free. 
Tis summer and the blue bird's song Is ringing over hill and plain; The meadow brooks flow swift along, Rejoicing in the summer rain; The clouds above, like white -sailed boats, Over a sea of azure floats, While ever from the hucksters ' throats Comes, "Cabbage! Hard -head cabbage!"  'Tis evening and the gentle breeze Is whispering softly through the trees; The birdies make the woods resound, While little nestlings huddle 'round; While falls to sleep the cool, dark night, Still in the fading, glimmering light, The huckster cries with all his might, "Corn, corn! Sure's you'r born, I got corn!"  'Tis August and the sweltering heat Beats down on housetop, street and plain; The breezes are but memories sweet, In vain we scan the skies for rain. The birds are still, the grass is dry, All nature for a rain doth sigh, While smiting e'en the hollow sky Comes "Cant'lope, cant'lope, cant'lope!"  September comes with skies of blue, And trees are borrowing every hue Of rainbow arch and sunset light To deck themselves in colors bright. Again the dallying zephyrs play With trembling leaves in colors gay, And still the huckster day by day Cries, "Millions! Watahmillions!"  It matters not if skies be fair, Or smothering be the humid air, Or the lightning's flashes mark the path Of the god's of thunder in their wrath All manner of weathers the huckster bears And, rain or shine, to town he fares,. And ever telleth of his wares, "Taters! Sweet pertaters!" 
There's a pretty maid, but I'm afraid    To give her name to you. She makes great pets of violets    Oh, would that she'd pet me, too!  Once in her youth, to tell you the truth,    When the violets she tried to smell, In some strange way, so sages say,    In her eyes their colors fell.  And these colors have stayed, for they never fade,    And when I saw her one time, I straightway then just reached for my pen    And tried to scribble a rhyme  But my consonents all went back on me    Four vowels deserted too; And since A, E, I, O, each went astray    My heart is just filled up with U! 
I had so many ships at sea, That had they all come home to me, No port on earth could hold them all— So many ships, both great and small.  Some of my ships went down at sea, But four came safely home to me : Beauty, Honor, Glory, Gold! The world thinks me rich with a wealth untold.  But I am as poor as a girl can be, For, somewhere, out on life's rough sea, Tossed by the winds of "It cannot be," That one ship, Love, is lost to me.
In the west the sun is dying. Fading slowly now from sight, And the hours are swiftly flying That bring on the silent night.  Gently sighs the evening breezes, While the summer day doth wane. How the bird's last song-note pleases, As she seeks her nest again.  Vesper bells are loudly pealing, Clear their tones fall on the air; While the night shades swift are stealing, Vesper bells call us to prayer.
Quiet, restful shades are stealing Softly o'er the peaceful earth, And my soul with subdued feeling Turns from laughter and from mirth  To the Saviour, pure and holy, To the One, whose name is Love, To the Christ, so meek and lowly, Who doth rain in heaven above.  Lowly and with deep emotion, Kneel I at the mercy seat, Where my soul in rapt devotion Finds its rests and joy complete.  O, these quiet evening hours, Unto holy mem'ries given, Sancttfy to God our powers Make the spirit meet for heaven! 
I It was on Mount Olympus, in a still hour of the night, The gods were all assembled, and the moon shone full and bright; The nightingales were singing gay with fond, full -throated ease, On middle moonlight mounted and the lofty limbs of trees. II The liquid songs of music the nightly songsters made, Filled all the air with melodies and floated down the glade: But now they all are silenced, and such sober stillness falls As haunts dead men's lifeless breast or pictures on the walls. III On that night Paul and Peter, two Apostles sacred came To pass their judgment on the gods and persecute the same. Around their heads were halos of a holy, splendid sheen, Below, the gods assembled, awaiting dread were seen. IV And Peter motioned with his hand and forward Zeus came, Full proud and brave of his renown and of his lasting fame; But as he stood before the man that fished in Galilee, He thought of titles he had lost-his high supremacy. V He raised his head in high disdain and anger fierce and dire, His eyes shown as the lightnings, lcoking, acting, burning ire; An' lightning 'gan to flash an' flame an' snap an' hiss an' roar, An' all Olympus 'gan to shake as in the days of yore. VI But Peter pressed the fiery bolts with light, unerring tread, And turning to the ruler of this high Olympus, said: "Thou art condemned an' cursed an' judged through all eternity!" And Zeus vanished through the earth and said, "Necessity!" VII Poseidon, strong and mighty, next approached the holy man, With night depicted in his eyes, a trident in his hand. "An' thou art he who rules the waves," gocd Peter angry spurned Poseidon screamed with sudden pain an' into vapor turned. VIII Apollo and the muses nine behind him forward came, As if in turn it was their time to register their name; But wise Apollo turned to Paul and in a voice of dread, Resembling wondrous music mixed with mighty murmurs, said: IX "I am the essence of the soul of sweet humanity, The life an' health an' sportive youth of frolic gayety Slay me not! Protect me, Lord, for 'twas ordained on high That I be god of sacred song, and never, never die!" X The moment next of silence was when Peter raised his eyes, (An' Paul was meditating , ) and he looked up to the skies. The thoughtful Paul arose and said," This high behest I give, Let Song immortal, sacred, free, henceforth forever live!" XI Apollo with his lute in hand sat on the earthly ground, [ around; The night was clear, the fountains roared, and perfume smelled The muses nine like sisters dear did gather in a ring, An' tones of mighty minstrelsy they gan to gayly sing: XII "Holy Birth of God on High, To thy fost'ring care we fly, After meeting drearily. Joy and music do we bring Do protect us that we sing Songs of luscious melody.
Two maidens sat beside a brook, And both were young and both were fair; The rose vines, by the breezes shook, Wafted a fragrance round them there. They came each day to their secret bower, And lived their lives like a summer flower.  Once, while talking of this and that, In the deep shade of Nature's screen, Two gorgeous birds flew in and sat By the edge of this winding stream; One maiden, clasping her hands in glee, Cried: "One for you, deary, and one for me."  So running to the water's brink, Each reached out for the prize so fair; But alas! as quick as a wink Away flew the birds through the air. "I'll have you," cried one, "sail high or low;" The other said: "I don't want you; go."  So through the fields of ripening grain Followed one maid; the bird a-wing, Into the wood and out again, Then far down where the marsh-reeds sing; And as the bird circled its nest that night , It fell at the maiden's feet; dead from fright.  The bird to which the maid cried "go." Not afraid of her gentle voice, Piped a lay from the bush below, And plucked her bits of plumage choice; And then when it knew she would do no harm, It flew to her bosom so fair and warm.  And so has love for all time been; Be bold, and frighten him away; If mild, you make a slave of him; So maidens, list to what I say: Don't chase after love, as the foolish do; Be gentle and kind, and he'll come to you. 
There is music in a cabin way down in Tennessee, And there's a dusky hero in the Tenth Cavalry. A littie pickaninny was scared almost to death, And of a thousand troopers, most all held their breath, On the field of Chickamauga, this little native strayed, Where the government, in manoeuvers, its troopers had arrayed. He was looking at the soldiers on the famous battlefield, When he was seen a few yards off by the the Tenth as it swiftly reeled, Of course you know they won't relent, when ordered to a charge, Nor a child, unless by Providence, escapes a troop so large. That Providence was in the Tenth 'mongst soldiers trained for strife, It proved their training taught them save, as well as take a life. A trooper spurred his steed just a litlle in advance, As he muttered meekly and grabbed his only chance, Then he just leaned in his saddle and gave a hasty scoop; He saved the pickaninny, and his comrades gave a whoop. Envenoi There is music in a cabin way down in Tennesee And there's a dusky hero in the Tenth Cavalry.
Bitter the wind, the path is rough, Spent is my soul as I plod my mile; I do not ask a smoother path, Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.  Scarce is the wine, the fare is poor, Athirst is my soul as I plod my mile: I do not ask for flask or meat, Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.  Heavy my load, the meed is small, Weary my soul as I plod my mile: I do not ask for rest or gold, Since Thou dost give the strength to smile.  With strength to smile I'll keep the way, And breast the storm as I plod my mile: No trial of earth but I can bear, Since Thou dost give the strength to smile. 
I hear a voice,--a plaintive, patient sound,    A whisper low, A murmur soft, steals all around,    Heard oft before.  That sound, earth-born now rises to the skies,    Fills all the air With yearning to be heard that never dies,    Goes everywhere.  Not from the beggars' idle task,    It comes to you, 'Tis from the hearts of freemen--men who ask    But Justice true.  That voice-soul cry of an awakening host    Calls for its own, It stalks right in like Banquo's ghost,    Will not "begone!"  Ye rulers of a state, did ye not hear    His passive plea? Wilt turn deaf ear to plaintive prayer,    Which calls to thee?  Oh! Nation great--let memory bear thee back    To earlier days When struggled thou on war's relentless rack,    In fearful phase.  In those dark days, when in the balance hung    The fair young life Thy honor, by this voice not once was stung    With treason's rife.  The owner of that voice, thy armies fed,    He toiled for thee On countless fields of war he fought and bled,    'Till thou wert free.  When slavers base, with thy permission made    His life a hell, This voice was never heard thee to upbraid,    It wished thee well.  O country proud--with undying boast    Of Liberty, Wilt thou, with thy victorious vaunting host,    An ingrate be?  I dreamed long since that voice had lost its tone    Of beggars' plea, And in my sleep me thought that voice did scorn    To not be free.  I heard once more its stirring sounds again,    Its summons grand, Its call brought forth ten thousand black-faced men    At its command.  It begged no more, but sounded in its power,    O'er all the earth, And bondsmen hailed the crucial hour    Of Freedom's birth. 
Why stand ye there face down, strong man? Lamenting o'er the years thou'st spent Inserving paler men their plan;  In paying meaner men their rent;  In hiring weaker men thy arm; Those men who send abroad alarm The danger thou dost threaten them  Of equal craving for the light To see the wrong, its tide to stem , To live a man and wield thy might?  Lament not o'er the time thou'st lost  In loving men who show their hate For thee and thine,and keep the cost Of friendship where to reach the rate Thou must unman thyself of thought And hope and pride, of ideals wrought Soul deep byloving angels touch.  They may all go the truth to give: Both they and it are not worth much  Compared with God and life to live.  In thee is ev'ry function right  Of head and heart and hand; 'tis true! Confide to them thy will, and blight The source which holds to thee the View Of endless serfdom for thy years. Lament no more! Clear up thy tears! Lift up thy drooping form and head! The hour has come to think, to stır, To work. Thy friends are all not dead. God reigns to yet thy foes deter.
Thou Black, with matchless strength, wake up! These years of untold schemes to keep Thee drinking bitters from the cup Of Servitude, and thus to sleep, Have kept thy soul and mighty brain From joining in life's sweet refrain. Wake up!  Look to the light beyond the hills Bright shining in resplendent hues; Look to the mighty deed that stills The wailing of the Russian Jews; Look high to God, the Prince of Peace Who speaks, and men their warfares cease. Look up!  Enter thy protests full and strong 'Gainst those whose hands thy treasure rob 'Gainst those who bind thee down by wrong And in their mean enslaving orb Consign thee to a place with herd. Assert thyself! Speak out thy word! Contend!  By that which others make the goal, You're made: gold, land, and learning true, A loving heart, a quickeu'd soul, The earth a full commanding view. Wake up! Look up! And, hard contend For that the ages cannot rend. And live.

WHEN a man who is married stays out half the night And gambles and drinks and looks for fight, Then goes home to wifie, all cross and black,-- At the least provocation he gives her a smack, Then runs the poor creature way out of the yard, And yet every day she's working hard; And she with her children don't know what to do, I wouldn't care much for her happiness, WOULD YOU?  WHEN a man who is single, without chick or child Instead of being frugal, steady and mild Goes out every night, with some maiden petite, To spend all his earnings to see some " great sight," To ball and theatre and pleasure resorts,--- He, dressed in his best, some lady escorts, When board bill, house rent and other things are due, And he loses his job in the Winter time, too, I wouldn't care much for his comfort, WOULD YOU?  WHEN a man who has preached for forty odd years, Who has flooded his Bible with fervent tears, Who never gave an instructive talk, but dwelt at length on "how to walk;" Who scoffs at the young folks ' progressive ideas And holds the old "fogies" in superstitious fears-- Who goo goos at the best looking sisters in the church And yet tells them to live right or they'll be left in the "lurch" When he comes down to die and say "adieu;" I wouldn't care much for his heaven, WOULD YOU?  WHEN a little colored child of three years or more  Has sense enough only to bellow and roar, Who is ugly enough to stop a runaway steed, And who never satiates its awful greed When it bawls and squalls from morn till night, Which is enough to make St. Peter fight, The mother calls it her "little drop of dew," But I wouldn't change a rag-doll for the dew-drop, WOULD YOU?  WHEN a woman goes from door to door and slanders one's name, Her only ambition is to lie and reputation maim; Who has no taste for literature or things which are refined, Nor cares for culture, or progress, or nothing of the kind, Nor knows the care of children, nor how to raise them right, But takes delight in tattling and figuring in a fight, Whose only aim in life is to raise a hullabaloo, I wouldn't care for her intellectual or moral qualities, WOULD YOU?

December comes, snows come,    Comes the wintry weather; Faces from away come    Hearts must be together.       Down the stair- steps ofthe hours       Yule leaps the hills and towers    Fill the bowl and hang the holly,    Let the times be jolly.  Day comes, and night comes    And the guests assemble Once again the old dream comes   That I would dissemble,       Falls a shadow 'cross the floor,       Seen!-and is seen no more.    O that memory would forego    The hanging of the mistletoe. 
And so thou'rt gone, O brother to the night! After the years of waiting and the pain, After the striving and the stress thou'rt gone! After the pulsing heart-throb and the fret, The quick reward, the sudden voice of fame, The noisy clamor of a great world's praise, The great far-sight into the heart of things, Thou'rt gone, and wilt be with us here no more. We loved thee, brother, in this nether light, With hearts more full of love than we did dream; We loved thy voice, thy work, they heart, thy hope, Thy aspiration and enlightened view, We loved thee in the darkness of the year When thou didst tread the borderland of death; And love thee now with that far greater love That beckons us to thy eternal light. And when in some far-off hereafter day The voice of Fame shall speak her last decree, When she shall summon from the wreck of worlds The names that Time's great movement shall defeat, And when then she shall stand beside thy tomb, The laurel in her hand, and think on thee, Tis then will be thy word upon the scroll: He voiced the yearning of a people's soul. 
I did not dream when first I saw you, dear, That I should ever love you-- didnot dream that by and by I should unhappy deem Each day that brough no message to my ear; You were so young, so wicked, and so near To all that pained me that it did not seem That sometime in the after years the gleam That comes with love would bid me have no fear; But all those days are over and are gone; Above them rests the Never-Nevermore; At midnight in the silence and anon It is your voice that trembles o'er and o'er-- Your heart that thrills me with its own sweet tone-- Your love that bids me claim you all my own. 
Oft I remember all the golden days And all the many gilded nights full-blown With murmured music and with whispered lays Of never-ending faith, each in his own; Oft have I revelled in the blissufl gaze With which your heart would answer mine, full grown With love, until a night (ah, me! our ways!) When you for love gave laughter and a stone For bread, comes up before me with its pain; Then all the raging madness and the fret And the hot flood of tears comes back again-- Comes back with all its bitterness, and yet-- The beauty and the music still remain, Beauty and music I can ne'er forget. 
Once there lived three common people In a log hut with no steeple    A colored man, his wife and little girl; The mother first departed, And she left them broken hearted,    While their brains were reeling in a dizzy whirl.  And next old Father Totten, Whose hair was white as cotton,    And who had served for three score years a slave, Went away and left Lucinda And may the gods defend her,    While her father lies a-sleeping in his grave.  So those humble old-time people, Whose hut was void of steeple,    Left "Cindy" there to labor and to moan: To plant the corn and cotton Near the log hut that was rotten,    Till she became a woman fully grown.  Her parents they had taught her To cook, and to bring the water    From nature's little spring beneath the hill: To labor late and early, With no trace of being surly,    And bring home sacks of white meal from the mill.  This girl who was not charming Gave all her time to farming,    And learned the art of how to sow and reap; Her faithfulness to duty Made up her loss of beauty,    And gained for her such friends as she could keep.  Lucinda did the ditching, She scrubbed -she did the stitching,    And had to drive the mules and haul the wood; And she was always ready, With patient hand and steady,    To help the folks in all the neighborhood.  It must not be forgotten That beside the corn and cotton    She had a score of beehives on a shelf. She sold the wax and honey, Which brought her lots of money    And added quite a good deal to her pelf.  It was this Lucinda Totten, Who hoed the corn and cotton,    While living in a log hut all alone, Who saved up every penny Till she acquired so many    She bought a little cottage of her own.  So now adieu, Miss Totten, You'll never be forgotten    By friends who have a knowledge of your fame; You'll be loved by many neighbors Who will always praise your labors    While the title of this song shall bear your name.
Poor wounded Heart, Alone, forsaken as it is Tis faithful yet-- All that is left is thine And no regret.  Poor wounded Heart, The drops of blood that from it ooze Are Nature's tears; They pass away with the lonely night And the empty years.
All things of earth may soon or late Pass quietly through an open gate          Called Nevermore; And back again there's no return, Although our hearts do often yearn To clasp some dear one, loved and true, Who has that mystic gate passed through, Adown this weary vale of tears, And heeding not the months and years, Earth and its fulness rush right on, Pass through and are forever gone.  At morn we laugh and joke and prate, And think not of the sombre gate          Called Nevermore; But, 'ere the evening shadows fall, Through tears we view the funeral pall Of one who sang his sweet, sweet lay From eerly morn till the close of day; And he who sang to us of yore Goes on as others did before Has done what each of us must do: The gate of Nevermore passed through.  But who is this gifted one so dear, Whose song of the weary heart bring cheer          Forevermore?  Paul Dunbar, who from heaven doth shine Upon your pathway and on mine. Though gone a higher sphere to fill, His echoing lyrics vibrate still And generations yet unknown Shall reap the sweetness he has sown, For glory opened wide the door When he passed through the gate called Nevermore! 
In queenly state she sits at the gateway of the South —    And lifts with conscious pride her stately head : Fair Atlanta feels her worth, and her children are elate,    As thro' her streets they go with happy tread. She has sons of many kinds, she has sons of many hues,    And she says she cares for all, but this we know, Tho' she exacts of each alike service, revenue, respect,    The blacks get of her favor but scant show! Yet the harder do they strive her good will and grace to win.    Keeping step with progress — forward without pause! Gaining knowledge, getting wealth, doing all things duly meet.    Hoping thus to gain Atlanta's prized applause. But alas! 'tis all in vain, for she hates with bitter hate    These poor blacks who aye remind her of her shames; Of her greed for wealth and power, of her base consuming lust:    Noble striving but the more her wrath inflames. Then to hide from honest eyes her blood-guiltiness and sin,    She most cunningly contrives a wicked plot — Subtly spoken a base word, then this cry against the blacks    Cleaves the night ! "Revenge! lynch, slaughter and spare not!" Three awful nights she reveled in a carnival of crime,    Three days or e'er the tension was relieved; When her thirst for blood was sated, the whole nation stood aghast.    Her cry of "Rape," no more the world deceived! Lamentations, bitter sobs, heart-wrung groans the soft winds bore    Thro' the streets where lay the victims of her rage; Helpless age and guiltless youth, innocence and trusting truth —    It had taken all, her fury to assuage. Dread Atlanta nevermore can the crimson stain erase,    Nor the foul blot wipe from off fair history's scroll ; This fell deed shall e'er arise, ghost-like from the mists of time    To confront and terrify her guilty soul!
There came a dark youth singing in the dawn Of a new freedom, to a mellow lyre, Refining, as with touch of an Apollo's fire, The songs a lowly people sang upon A toilsome way. The night of gloom was gone; He stood, full-throated, cheering son and sire To garner grain, despising rain and mire Of yesternight. "To-day," he sang, "toil on And up, my race, from vale toward glory's crest!" Men marvelled at the singer, strong and sweet. He left the forest, drenched with storms of night, And faced the morning, beautiful with light, To die while shadows still fell toward the west, And leave his laurels at a people's feet.
The South's the sin? The North's the glory? Laugh out of court the hackneyed story. The sin took root in the nation's heart And North and South played a dual part.  The North and the South wore a cheek of shame, Till a life of woe wrought an earth of flame. And who were the heroes? All who fell, Whether North or South in the nation's hell.  And who were the heroes? Great souls who fed The nations's maw with the nation's dead Till the nation's blood slew the nation's curse And made man free as the universe.  Neither Grant of the North nor Lee of the South Shall link his name with the cannon's mouth, Neither Lee of the South nor Grant of the North Shall stand accused when the blame goes forth.  In the South's warm heart, on the North's just tongue, A dual epic of peace is sung, With regret for the bond and hope for the free And a God-like love for Grant and Lee.  
World-tired, I trudge my onward way O'er the same drear path from day to day; There seems no hope, like some guiding star, To shine down upon me from afar.  Man-tired, I long for a forest wild Where Nature and I may roam, undefiled By humans and their doubts and woes--- For some glad spot where the river flows.  Gold-tired --- and oh! for some happy land Where you're paid for a deed by a friendly hand Where glitter and gold are mere paltry things And gold and gain are not worshipped as kings.  Life-tired, I long for the restful end, But my soul still under its load must bend; Death holds aloft, he will not come nigh, Though I crave and pray for the right to die.
Because I had loved so deeply,    Because I had loved so long,  God in His great compassion    Gave me the gift of song.  Because I have loved so vainly,    And sung with such faltering breath, The Master in infinite mercy    Offers the boon of Death.
With what thou gavest me, O Master,    I have wrought. Such chances, such abilities, to see the end was not for my poor eyes,    Thine was the impulse, thine for forming thought. I have wrought,    And these sad hands have right to tell their story. It was no hard up-striving after glory,    Catching and losing, gaining and failing, Raging me back at the world's raucous railing.    Simply and humbly from stone and from wood, Wrought I the things that to thee might seem good.    If they are little, ah God! but the cost, Who but thou knowest the all that is lost!    If they are few, is it the workmanship true? Try them, and weigh me what 'ere be my due! 
If the muse were mine to tempt it    And my feeble voice were strong, If my tongue were trained to measures,    I would sing a stirring song. I would sing a song heroic    Of those noble sons of Ham, Of the gallant colored soldiers    Who fought for Uncle Sam!  In the early days you scorned them,    And with many a flip and flout, Said "these battles are the white man's    And the whites will fight them out." Up the hills you fought and faltered,    In the vales you strove and bled, While your ears still heard the thunder    Of the foes' increasing tread.  Then distress fell on the nation    And the flag was drooping low; Should the dust pollute your banner?    No! the nation shouted, No! So when war, in savage triumph,    Spread abroad his funeral pall-- Then you called the colored soldiers,    And they answered to your call.  And like hounds unleashed and eager    For the life blood of the prey, Sprung they forth and bore them bravely    In the thickest of the fray. And where'er the fight was hottest,--    Where the bullets fastest fell, There they pressed unblanched and fearless    At the very mouth of hell.
Come, list to my song of the comrades, Scattered the world around—- The good men and the true men In the brotherhood army found.  Be they white or black or red men, The shade of the skin is naught; True greatness is counted by heart-beats, True manhood is measured by thought.  Among them the highest is servant, The highest is that one who pays In deeds of love and mercy His vows through all the days.  Among them the one rule is justice, And upon the old ladder of fame Each round belongs to the brother Who first puts his foot on the same.  They are lifters and helpers, not leaners; They are willing whenever they can To give a hand to the fallen And aid to a brother -man.  The sweep of the seas may divide them, Yet their good deeds have made them agirth, And like rays of sunlight their blessings Reach the uttermost ends of the earth.  Shoulder to shoulder they march them, To-day as in the days of yore—- The call of the past behind them, The call of the future before.  The call of the present is urgent For men of leading and light, Who are ready to march with these comrades And strengthen their hands in the fight.  There are other fields to conquer, And other heights to attain The brotherhood army is sweeping O'er mountain and sea and plain.  Oh, heed it, and join the great army! Men of all colors fall in! And help your advancing comrades Eternal honors to win!  For comrades they are--ay, comrades! All the wide world around, The good men and the true men In the brotherhood army found. 
It's a lonely little cabin In a lonely little lane, An de cabin is so shabby Dat it won't keep out de rain; But no mattah whar I trabbles, An' no mattah whar I roam, I kin see de smoke dat rises F'om my little cabin home.  'Cou'se, my cabin's down in Georgia, Whar de mo'nin' glories climb, An' about in all de tree tops Birds is singin' all de time, Whar de sugah-cane is sweetah Dan de honey in de comb An' dere's no place Nowhar bettah Dan my Georgy cabin home!  I kin see my Lucy standin,' Peepin th'oo de winder cracks, Watchin' rabbits in de front yard, Makin' all deir pooty tracks; Er I sees her in de kitchen, Makin' bread dat rise like foam, An' I wants to go, I tell you, To my Georgy cabin home!  But I's up hyar in dis prison, 'Cause I made some "moonshine" rye, An' I may not see my cabin Nevahmo' untell I die; Yet I's gwine to tell St. Peter In his pooty heabenly dome, Ef he'll be so please to let me Come back to my Georgia home. 
The heavenly choir was incomplete, The Father had need of a voice, And downward to earth He straight way sent Death, with the name of His choice.  Swiftly Death rode to a poet's abode--- And now, the dim river passed, Paul Dunbar sings in the heavenly choir, And is crowned with the laurel at last! 
Because you love me not, you say, We two must walk apart; But, though you may not know, Jerome, I'm ever where thou art.  Love unreturned is love the same As when at first 'tis born And where'er you go, to you Jerome, I shall fly on the wings of the morn!  There is no place you can hide But my love shall find the spot, For I love you still and will, Jerome, Although you love me not! 
The angry cloud -rack in the scowling sky Like some forbidding fortress far-off looms, And oft, like sound of cannon crashing nigh, The intermittent peal of thunder booms.  But instantly the winds sweep o'er the fields Where cloud-rack all its valiant host arrays, Then 'neath the sun the phantom fortress yields, And topples in red ruin while we gaze. 
Let gales come over the mountains, Let gales come over the sea, Forever, forever, Lucretia, They are blowing for you and for me.  Let summer be long and dreary, Or winter be cheerless and chill, All weathers, all weathers, Lucretia, Are as sweet as a breath from the hill.  Each day we walk in the sunshine, And we rest us in peace with each night, Contentment, contentment, Lucretia, Makes us happy in darkness or light.  
When the harvest-time is nigh Golden sheaves greet every eye, And we hear the song of reapers Ringing through the Autumn's sky; And we listen to the echoes, As the happy hills reply, When the harvest-time is nigh, When the harvest-time is nigh!  When the harvest-time is nigh, 'Cross the wheat-fields and the rye, There's a sound of peace and plenty In the breezes passing by; And we see the pledge and promise Of the Harvest Home on High, When the harvest-time is nigh, When the harvest-time is nigh!
Give me a corner in some lone hut, Or a place in the woods by a stream, And leave me there to sing my song And in mystic fancies dream.  Therein I find my sweetest joy, Singing aloud to myself; Let the world wag on -- I sing my song, Unmoved by its praise or its pelf.  My singing would lose its charm for me,  If my purse instead of my heart Dictated the measures that I lisp To suit the broker's mart.  I put the world beneath my feet. With all that it can grant, When all alone in aquiet nook My heavenly song I chant.  He misses the whole of the poet's art Who does not sing from within, And is not hampered one moment by The world's incongruous din.  For surely 'tis true, when forth from the heart Impassioned lyrics roll Through all the years the music's heard, Pealing from soul to soul.  And hereby we know the immortal band And the bard of one short day -- The song of the first springs out of his heart, While the other one sings for pay. 
I used to take my pen in hand    In days of long ago, Or else no letter I could send    To absent friend or foe.  But now I take no pen in hand    Yet, after the day's alarms, The letter's gone and I fondly take    The typewriter in my arms.
And we laid 'em slowly 'neath a nameless mound, As the Autumn leaves serenely were descending, And sad and silent there were gathered round The reft ones who with sorrowing were bending.  Not there from restless nights of fevered pain That proffer death as life's surcease from sorrow; But void of wrongs these cruelly were slain Amid their struggles for bread on the morrow.  Whatever your misfortune, theirs was worse, For they knew not its plotting, or their crime; But fell a holocaust to color's curse, While duty-bent they labored in their prime.  And they toiled duty-bent for this reward: "No quarters to those whom the State disowns;" The stars and stripes, that should them shield afford, Now pirate's emblem with its skull and bones.  Haughtily speak they of the murdered dead, Not deeming them worth more than passing mention; Yet Sampson's Temple on his captor's head 'Mid mocking thundered down an inattention.  God of our fathers through their darkest way, Thou who proud nations humblest in their might, Are these those gloomiest hours ere breaking day, Or gathering storms that usher in the night?  Thy will done, O Lord; and not too long Withhold us justice: on our darkened road Be Thou our light, else from long years of wrong We give way under life's augmenting load.  Calmly we laid them 'neath the dewy sod Where the Morn's waking clarion shall find them; In love for country, and faith in their God They filled the humble duties He assigned them. 
Before the Ark on Ararat a lodgment found The Elsmeres dwelt in clouds of doubt and fear: And, still, when Time has reached its closing year, That doubt and fear the future's sky will bound. No faith can make the hidden mysteries clear That shroud the glories of the Eden where Our hopes, through all the ages, circle 'round, Like ships at anchor in a haven fair. We fondly deem we know from whence we came, And to what destiny at last shall go, When vanish all of pomp and power and fame: But, reason as we will, we do not know!    And so, like Elsmere, many pine and die,    Victims of life's remorseless whence and why.
LET mad ambition strive to gain The cherished wish that yields but pain; Let others seek for wealth alone, And with its cares their lives atone; But let me live my fleeting hour The slave of Love's divinest power.
The pathway up the mountain may be plain, But who can rob th' ascent of toil and pain? Far up the valley's sloping sides we gaze To where the summits tower in misty haze; Or , when the sun dispels the clouds that lower, The giant stands disclosed in matchless power. Nature's eternal walls that pierce the clouds, Pendant like gorgeous floating muslin shrouds, Charm and o'erawe the soul that looks to God Who dwells in skies, in peaks afar, in sod And feels the force that made the prophets rear Their sacred altars in the upper air.  The soul will lift itself above the clay And seek beyond the earth eternal day. And never can the man who once has seen Unveiled the myst'ries of the mountain's sheen, Its vastness and its strength and rugged brow, Feel as he felt before , content to dwell Cooped in the confines of his native cell. Far out into th ' unknown he takes his flight, Seeking for sunbeams through the pathless night.
Old Father Time has added a leaf, To the volume of the years, A virgin page, where joy and grief Will write their smiles and tears, And what the leaf may tell, who knows, Ere it's last line is complete; Yet, judged by the past, it is safe to suppose, "Twill the same old tales repeat."  Then let it bring what'er it may To brighten or dim the hours, Hope still will point in its old time way From thorns to the sun-kissed flowers. Let croakers hold to their faces long, Their prophecies cannot appall, While hearts give voice to the cheery song, "A Happy New Year to all!"
Oh! mighty edifice of quarried stone, What sacred treasures numberless are thine. There seeks his level on the sheeted dome, The lavished glory of a nation strong, The golden sun in central lucent bloom. In simple wonder in his fertile fields Along suburban banks of flowing streams, And driving cityward his laboring team, The farmer this majestic structure sees Abundant with the toil of vanished years. Those men who wrote, unconscious of their fame, In this new world review the home of man Again in peaceful bust on honored throng; Lo! Dante from a quiet granite nook His silent glance cast on the open world, As if to breathe upon his slumbering time, The life and spirit of these alien days; Amid impressive chimes of noonday bells, Which bring melodiously on iron tongues An incantation as the thoughts rove back. Huge Neptune, stern in mythological calm, The towering symbol to the fountain place, And everywhere displayed by hand of art, The emblematic good of knowledge great, Too, all the lovely forms of fabled realms. Within the reader's marble-circled room, The vivid light from heaven soften'd is, And in the lucid mellowness is seen, Complacent in the burnished tranquil bronze, The peerless image of the old Shakespeare wise, With all his lofty compeers gathered 'round. A splendid palace for the living dead! Ah! but the period now distant will exist, When the owl's doubly melancholy song Among the mellow archives shall resound Prolific with the notes of grand decay And through the darksome passages shall flow In many a silent beam, the silver flood From Cynthia's high roving ancient keep. Ah! now for some enchanted Byron's pen On this as on the Coliseum scene, To trace another few immortal lines; Then generations, yet unborn will view In mouldering and gray magnificence The crowning labor of a sleeping age. 
A flower grew in my garden, 'Twas beautiful to see; But, ah! 'Twas left neglected, And then it sickened me.  There grew, like the flower, a maiden, So beautiful to see; But she was left neglected So vain, so vain was she.  For beauty unsupported By virtue's sweetness 'round Will find its grave quite early Deep in the dark, damp ground.

Night comes unnoticed o'er the Eastern hills, The blessed benediction of the day, And with his soothing balin he gently bathes The hot check of the day as on its way To new born skies it glides down in the West'  And then the stars,bright children of the night, Unveil their faces to the earth below, The moon rejoices at the sun's retreat, His face is wreathedinsmiles and, all aglow, He takes the sceptre that the sun laid down.
When thoughts of our condition in the past---    Of how like beasts of burden meekly we    The painful load of sorrow bore, not free From man's accursed cruelty so vast; And then of how the shackles fell at last---    'In night's deliberation came to me,    I asked, O God,was it not done through Thee? And soon, as though my question was forecast, Avoice angelic in agentle tone     Replied, "I've watched o'er you and ever will; I knew your agony and heard your groan;    And you I'll guard against all treatment ill, If you my name and cause will ever own    And all requirements of my laws fulfill." 
Of life and death, of joy and pain, And all the throbbing things between, His spirits knows: for he can see Beyond earths's temporal, veiling screen.  Of mortal things, and lo! can make, The rapt, inspired minute tell Of truth from far, faint realms of dream, And moods that cast a magic spell!
Pity him not who in the world-sense fails, Whose aim, truth -seeking, trails a light afar; But rather pity him who still assails Pregnable heights, and never sees a star.
As some sea-faring bird, beat from its home On ocean's rolling tide by raging storm, Hopeless and spent, by faith alone doth roam Till driven at last to coves that shield from harm:  So I, caught in tho whirl of Godless power, Of passion's wild, and dark unbridled lust, By the sad strife and tumult of the hour Am tossed to God's clear heights of love and trust. 
His life like some aged tool he wears To bluntness with the toil of years; And deems with simple childlike trust, Less use doth bring devouring rust,  Yet he who gave it makes a yield Of sweetness from the lilied field, And gives a watcher of his skies On earth the boons of paradise. 
You ask why Ise happy,  Jus' lack Ise gwine to fly; Well, whah's you been a-stayin'? Yoh membry sho ain't spry. Ain't you felt de 'lectric thrill Thu de air a-hummin'? The smell o' good things cookin'? De signs o' good times comin '?  Seed a 'possum tother day  Fresh from a 'simmon tree Good gracious man! take-take keer 'Fore sin gets de heels o ' me. Whah's ol' Tray 'n ' all de houn's? Dat 'possum sure is mine, Gwine to sary ' a warr'nt on him, Fore ol' Ephrim makes de fin'.

D'want no pardner in dis deal, Case when I cotch dat 'possum He'll make my Christmas meal.  You'se jus' wantin' to be 'roun', I reads you thu' an' thu', Bout de time he's good an' brown To eat up ha'f my stew. Well, I spec's you can come— Bring Marfy, too-an' say!

The last chill wind brought snow and ice and sleet; Like Christmas trees a dawn from Christmas night The forest were a wreath of silvern white; At morn the sun burst full with glimmering heat, The South wind waft, across the greening wheat, A robin's note to cheer my heart's dim night; Borne back to answer him my soul's first flight This tribute to his vernal song's high beat: Didst thou from Hope's high minaret foresee Wild March with sheeted, icy hands of storm Would wake the trees and set the sap-life free? The faith of thy frail song-insistent, clear, Though faltering notes, hath made the day less drear.
Oh, oak! long years the stress of storm and wind Has made thy limbs exult in growing thew; And deeper , surer in the earth descend The thousand tenderils that were strengthening you; With best of sun and song and rain and dew High on the hill thy strength, tho storm and wind Oft did thy tender thewless youth unbend; But greater thou in limb and power grew. Oh, mighty oak! with faith serene and sure, Impart to me the secret of thy girth, Invest me master of thy patient will; That through the coming years I may endure, And deeper rooted in the fields of earth, At last, as thou, be sovereign of a hill.
Give me a heart made brave and strong A life lived sweet in sorrow's hour, A living Faith serene in song, And noble love's diviner power; Let smiles break swift on frown or tears, And peace be happy dove in strife; I have but once to live my years, 'Twere good I live a larger life.  Give me sweet faith in other men; My life is stronger when I trust; I wish to love them , tho ' they sin, And help them live , because I must. My life is bound at every turn In common interest with the good Of other lives ; and tho' I yearn For trust, I'll give the trust I should.  I wish to grow in mind and heart, To live each day on thought's high plain Full conscious of life's nobler part Full conscious of life's highest gain; So live to-day to-morrow's sun Will rise in glory's crown arrayed, Upon no duty left undone, Or sacrifice I should have made.  Each day is link in life's long chain, And weak or strong as we shall live; The whole's not stronger 'neath the strain, Than strength the weakest link can give, Each day I'll live as tho ' my last, As tho ' before me was unrolled The future , present and the past My whole life's good upon a scroll.  And writ in gold my days of good , Tho' blank the leaves of idle years , I oft may read in solitude How much was wrought by contrite fears— How much by sincere sympathies The crust I shared, the trust I gave, The hope inspired -felicities That made a sad heart light and brave.  I shall not live a mussel-shell; My heart shut fast against the world; Nor live where others cannot dwell Ensphered too high above the whirl, And busy life of men who toil; But close where break the cries of strife:--- Some lower plain anear the soil--- I'll live out full a larger life.
O thou who ruleth all, At thy footsteps I fall; Hear thou me when I call,--    I am but dust.  Thou art my only stay, Thou wilt not say me nay, Lead thou me all the way,    In Thee I trust.  I would thy name adore, I long to love Thee more, My heart is bleeding sore    For Thee, O Son.  Grant both to serve and love, As angels do above; Descend, O heavenly Dove,    Almighty One. 
Poor and black is "Bouquet Charlie." No one knows another name People call him simple minded, And laugh at him---What a shame!  Nothing very strange about him, Save the story that they tell Of his always wearing flowers In his shabby coat lapel .  Once I asked him ,---"Bouquet Charlie , Tell me why from day to day Never have I failed to find you With a button-hole bouquet?"  Quick his dim old eyes grew tearful, Mothah's gone to heaben, suh, An ' when dyin ' mother axed me Please to wear a rose fo' huh!"  Poor and black is "Bouquet Charlie," Simple minded, so they say, But a royal decoration Is his button-hole bouquet.  And of those who laugh at Charlie, Is there one who in earth's strife Is so loyal to a mother Every day of all his life?
SOME folks lake de dew ob Summer, Some folks lake de ba'm ob Spring, Odders hankers fer ole Autumn, But I laks what Winter bring. Winter eb'nins long an ' chllly, No'f win' knockin ' at yo ' do',  Sit an' hear de voice ob Nachur Tell de embers die down low.  ONE thing why I laks de Winter, Ain' much work a doin' den, Coffee roas'in in de skillet, Hog a fatt'nin ' in de pen. Rindy cooks de ole time cookin', T'ank de Lor ' I got her sho; Eb'ry night I praise de Fadder As de embers die down low.  TALK an' talk from dark tell midnight, TANuffin' 'tall ter call yer min'— Smoke house full,-corn an ' bacon,— 'Tater pumps all in a line. Winter eb'nings bring sweet mem'ries Ob de days so long ago, When I sat and talked wid Rindy Tell de embers died down low.  SOM'IN 'bout de Winter weatha' Meks yo' feel yo' aint so spry, Draws yo' nearer to de Fadder 'Cause yo' time hit mought be nigh. Yo' doan see no green leab's peepin,' Yo' doan hear de waters flow,- Curious thoughts dey come upon me When de embers die down low.  SOMETIMES I sees de Lan o' Beulah Shinin' fore dese dim ole eyes, For de time aint long, I feels it, 'Fore my soul am gwine ter rise To de lan' ob milk an' honey Where de Crystal Ribber flow,--- An' der wont be no mo' waitin ' Tell de embers die down low.
The winter winds are blowing, Soldiers true, soldiers true, And the angry sea is flowing Soldiers true; They are telling of your pride; There is naught for you to hide, For the right is on your side, Soldiers true!  The stars are shining brightly, Soldiers true, soldiers true, They are dancing rather sprightly, Soldiers true; And they say you are not to blame If you did not know the name, And they love you just the same, Soldiers true!  The moonbeams now are dancing, Soldiers true, soldiers true, They are darting and a-glancing, Soldiers true; They are watching now to see What your final fate will be, When the truth gains potency,— Soldiers true!  I hear dry leaves rushing, Soldiers true, soldiers true, And the winds again are rushing, Soldiers true; They know you've done no wrong And they sing a joyous song, And they sing it loud and long,— Soldiers true!  If you've done no sinful deed, Soldiers true, soldiers true, To grieve, you have no need, Soldiers true; So you must not hide your face, Although you've lost your place, You are not in deep disgrace, Soldiers true.  The "Christmas Bells " are ringing, Soldiers true, soldiers true, And the angels softly singing, Soldiers true; They seem to call your name, Saying "Isn't it a shame, That all should bear the blame," Soldiers true.  The clouds are drifting high, Soldiers true, soldiers true, They seem to touch the sky, Soldiers true; And they tell it o'er and o'er That you will go back once more To the place you had of yore, Soldiers true.  God's great Flag of Truth is flying, Soldiers true, soldiers true, High above the white man's lying, Soldiers true. Lift your eyes and see it there, Waving in the upper air; Up and throw away despair,-- Soldiers true! 
The ring of gold through centuries re-echoes, The air is pregnant with its clanking din, 'Tis worshipped now as when the proud patrician    Reveled in sin.  Men have been known to slaughter fellow-brothers To deal in deeds of death with daring bold, And purest lives marred by unholy vices    For sake of gold.  The miser sits within his lowly dwelling, And counts in silence there his hoarded gold; No lesson unto man of love or duty    His lips unfold.  Within the monastery's secret cloisters Where dwells the monk with humbleness profound Or where the chiming convent bells are ringing    There gold is found.  Deep in the cold, cold grave where all is silent Where mighty Death his wondrous change hath wrought, 'Tis there desires of earth are all forgotten    No gold is sought. 
I heard a sweet and gladsome lay From out the forest deep; 'Twas ere the glory of the day Had kissed the stars to sleep.  The organ tones, the chanting choir. Pealed forth on Easter tide; My soul was filled with Heavenly fire The earth was beautified.  The gentle breezes catch the strains And bear them all away; Just as a shadow ne'er remains But passes with the day.  Ye gentle zephyrs that have heard In fane and greenwood tree, The songs of choir and minstrel bird, Oh! bear them back to me.  I shall not hear the music roll On some glad Easter day, For zephyrs soft shall take my soul And bear it far away. 
When evening shadows gently fall,    I think of thee; When all is still, save song bird's call     I think of thee. The moon looks down and seems to smile, And bright stars twinkle all the while.  While evening breezes round me blow,    I think of thee. When western sky is all aglow     I think of thee. A gentle voice doth seem to say: "Sigh not; await the coming day." 
The Sun flared up in the eastern hills    And tore the shroud of night, The faithful guards at peep of day, Their blushing faces hid away    From that transcendent light.  From out his scabbard worn and old    The Storm King drew his blade; He blew his war horu loud and clear And rent the silence far and near ---    His angry host obeyed.  Thus while the day wept, dull and gray,    That Vandals held her king; The piercing flash from each shining blade With the rapid rumbling their laughter made.    Told of their revelling.  The Sun, when the Day was growing old,    Was nearing Evening's door, Then flung the Storm King over his crest Who hied away to the Ocean's breast,   The Sun was King once more. 
And yet my soul, 'tis well with thee, Tho' scant the harvests that we till; Hope bringeth joys; be still, be still.  What if the way be rough and hard Sometime will come a brighter day, Hope bringeth joy: this way, this way.  The world may wear a deepened frown -- What care thee for its coldness shown? Hope will not leave thee all alone.  Hope, precious spark, to which I owe The all that gives me greater will, And bids me to be still, be still. 
Rock-a-bye, baby, sleep on my breast,    Nothing can harm thee here; Rock-a-bye, baby, may sweet be thy rest,    Angels are hov'ring near.       Sleep, baby, sleep,       While watch I keep,       Father is lost on the deep.  Rock-a-bye, baby, so free now thou art,    Peace now has come to thee, Would that my sorrow like thine would depart    No more to trouble me.       Sleep, baby, sleep,       While watch I keep,       Father is lost on the deep  Rock-a-bye, baby, my dear little beam,    Fast now and prone in sleep, Care ever calleth across my dream    O'er thy fond pleasures creep.       Sleep, baby, sleep,       While watch I keep,       Father is lost on the deep.  Rock-a-bye, baby, soon labor will call    Call me away from thee; He will care for thee who careth for all,    Sweet will our union be.       Sleep, baby, sleep,       While watch I keep,       Father is lost on the deep. 
From out the Mystic somewhere, yet unknown, I came a stranger here, unmasked, to plan My journey in this life, a fleeting span, Ushered by Cosmic Law, I came alone. And fleeting years had passed before I knew I was; though mysteries surround me, like shroud, I wondered not whence came a star or cloud Or who had painted heaven a changeless blue. Before I left my home in distant clime, Stern Destiny had marked my humble lot. Helpless am I, past life and form forgot, I am an infant in the lap of Time. The stars light worlds in God's vast firmament That spin with rapid rate through boundless space. All, all the universe moves on apace Around some unseen star omnipotent. When I have stepped on board each drifting ship Within the fleet of planets and of stars Sailing toward that star past earthly bars, My journey will my waiting soul equip. Into the mystic somewhere yet unknown, I go some day to know another plan, When all is ended in this fleeting span Impelled by Cosmic Law, I go alone. 
Ye who would stop the progress of a race, Give ear; that race would question thee.  So base a deed as thine belies the name of man. This bickering that comes 'twixt clan and clan, Let Justice rule and prejudice erase. Ye call us enemies of thine to-day, But when the cannon sounded far away Calling thy fathers to the battle's din, This enemy upon thy threshold lay The watch dog, lest a foe should enter in. A friend or foe was he to thee and thine? This upward movement of a mighty host Is ever onward still. Like Banquo's ghost  They will not down, whatever you design To bruise and crush it with thy tyrant heel. The day is past when we knew but to kneel. Lost is thy purpose, as the wild bird's cry Within a storm. Its shriek is never heard Above the mutterings of the thunder's roar, Though Truth and Right upon the altar lie To see them cricified our hearts are stirred This sacrifice but makes Ambition soar To loftier heights, and we commit our plan To Him who better knows each struggling clan, To Him who rightly judges man and man.  
What made the pale-faced father frown And drive the girl away, When she had come in childish glee With his own sweet girl to play?  "Oh, papa, dear; do let her stay!" His little daughter cried. "Ah, no, my child!" the father said, And quickly turned aside.  What made the father say in scorn, With a look that seemed so wild, "That Thing's not fit to play with you, My darling little child?"  'Twas only the color of her skin That brought forth the father's scorn: 'Twas only because God made her black The day when she was born.  O, Father of Heaven and of Love, Will the angels say, "Go back?" Will they drive her away from the golden gate Because forsooth she's black? 
A day is but a little while, Let us live it at our best, Let every mortal wear a smile, If winds blow East or West.  A day is short; then sing a song, And never once complain; While life doth last, fight on, be strong. Spend not one day in vain.  The pris'ner in his cell at night Longs for another day A feeling of sadness and of fright Beclouds his dismal way.  A day is but a little while, Let's live it at our best When there are no days on the file, Then may we go to rest. 
There comes each year a season drear Which with its frosty breath Doth sing unto the saddened world The monrnful song of Death.  It slays the fair and fragrant lowers And drives the birds away To warmer climes, 'neath distant skies, Where all is bright and gay.  Upon the meadow's verdant for Itlays acarpet brown; And from the sighing, frost-kissed trees It blows the dead leaves down.  It whistles through the naked woods. In notes both fierce and shrill. Which echo and reverberate From valley, glade and hill.  The tender-hearted wint'ry clouds Shed cold tear drops of rain, As they behold the sad ,sad earth O'er which fair flowers lie slain.  And as in pain and grief we view Chilled Nature's gloomy face. Thoughts ofthe grave file through our souls In swift and breathless pace.  We think of dear departed friends Gone to that other land; And sigh to contemplate the hour When we must cross Death's strand.  But why should we thus quake with fear At thought of that last day? Twere' better that we should bedeck Our souls in pure array.
Blest trio of godly dowers! Music , poetry and flowers! By thy aid the weary soul Glimpses its celestial goal.  When the soul doth faint and sadden, Flowers purify and gladden: Poetry fresh vigor rings; And sweet music giveth wings.  Then the spirit spreads its pinions, And from trouble's dark dominions, With delight and rapture soars Straight to heaven's pearly doors.  Blest trio of godly dowers' May ye evermore be ours! What would Life to mortals be, Were their lives bereft of thee?  Over scenes of grief and sorrow, Anguish , deep despair and horror, Thou dost shed a beam so bright, That the darkness turns to light.  Even savage hearts beat faster, And acknowledge God as Master, When they hear thee in sweet speech, Of the great Creator teach.  He who values not thy treasure, And in thee doth find no pleasure, Worships sin and vice instead, And his soul is truly dead. 
The face is but a mystic veil of glass  Through whichmess the spirit's ev'ry changing mien Both show as plainly as do Time's swift feet, Which fly beneath the clock's clean, [crusted] screen.  Whenever pleasure, part, despair in hope, Dejection, gladness, sorrow, joy or  care, Essay as guests into the human heart, The tell tale face proclaims that they are there.  Yet there are seasons when the countenance By power of a wary, subtle soul, In forced to look serene and calm, although Beneath its surface stormy waters roll.  The smiling face that hides an aching heart Is but a lying servant, in fine gent, Who stands within the doorway of the soul And tells the world, "My master is not here."
I stood beside the bier of the dead, Shedding sad tears of sorrow and regret That mortals should have ever been beset By such a severance of life's slender thread. But while I stooped to kiss the cold forehead And the wan lips, now in death's rigor set, Pausing the while to vainly fume and fret, These tidings in the peaceful face I read: "Stand not, my love, and sullenly shed tears, Since life eternal crowns the soul set free When resurrection rends the sombre sod; But rather down upon thy knees make prayers: Say from thy soul of immortality, "For this good gift I fain would thank thee, God!
Her eyes beheld the hardship and the toil That smote her race on fair Columbia's soil, And yet a piece within her soul abode As though God spoke and lightened all her load!
His life so earthly to be spent, The greatest singer of his race His Lyre, a self-made instrument, But 'twas not commonplace; It murmured sweetly his folk lore In cadence all could understand; But then, again, his lyre could soar To heights most truly grand.  He loved his race, and sought to raise  It to a nobler, higher plane; Such was the burden of his praise Aye! even the refrain, One needs but to recall his verse That gladdens Ethiop's sorrowings Aye! one may say the universe -- Tis' "When Malindy Sings."   His "Strength of Gideon" is a strength To many halting brothers 'ways; Its fruitage will appear at length By bringing helpful, peaceful days. Although the Poet has gone hence His cheerful songs with us remain At once aglorious recompense-- He has not lived in vain.
WE hear of divers sayings, Read proverbs full of truth; To greatest age we hear them, From adolescent youth.  But that which shames all knowledge, And Reason doth impeach, Is this: "The white man's burden," Which o'er the world they preach.  Boasting of Christian goodness, Of Law and Equity, They fail to live their learning Of Moral probity.  From glutted town and province Where fortunes are denied, They sail the wide, wide ocean, Till they our shores have spied.  Thither they head: and landing With strange timidity, Receive our native kindness And hospitality.  Returning with the presents Of gold and priceless They call our lands benighted, And would their depths explore.  Our lands of dual greatness, Fertility and gold;— They confiscate and claim them With lying tongues so bold.  Their doctrines then, they teach us, Which eager we imbibe; But find them inconsistent, And shameful to our tribe.  They rob our gold and diamonds, With arms' defying power; And to our greatest sorrow, Our virgins they deflower.  And this, "the white man's burden!" To plunder, kill, deflower! Lay waste our Native glory, And falsely it endower!  Is this the heavy "burden" Throughout the world we hear? Aye! this the boasted "burden" Theft, Falsehood, Arms, and Fear!  Such arrant blatant boastings Contaminate our ear; Such arrant blatant boastings We hear from year to year!  And yet we hear them calmly, Resigning all our fate, To that great Power and Spirit, Who Times and men placate.  Ye sons of Ethiopia, Less boastful nations, all-- Courage! for soon such "greatness" Will totter, reel, and fall.  Ye Presidents and Princes, Who guide the stately helms, Kings of great tribes and peoples, Throughout the world -wide realms,  Behold the rank injustice To Ethiop's ebon sons; The lash, the whip, the wailings, The very blood that runs!  And this, "the white man's burden!"-- To plunder, kill, deflower! Lay waste our Native glory, And falsely it endower. 
Saint Valentine knocked at my door this morning. He handed me a letter, dear, from you, I fear to send one back lest he might read it, And so I'll have to make this picture do.  It's just a little picture of my heart, love, And see across the top I've written, "TRUE," For every time it beats I love you dearer So keep it, dear, it beats alone for you! 
What is the morning if the dew Only tear-drops seem to you?  What is sunshine ifits rays Bring to mind but sultry day?  What are flowers if the eye Only sees them fade and die?  What the maple if we see But the spent life of the tree?  But what love in these may be, If God's hand in all we see!
When the shades o' night are fallin' An' the sun has gone to rest, When the wee young birds are cuddled In the soft warm nest,  I love to saunter down the lane, An' loiter on the bars, An' look out o'er the gloomin' For the comin' o' the stars.  'Cause just across from where I watch Echoing thru the pine tree boughs  I can hear sweet Nellie Master's voice A callin home the cows.  There's a band o' music down in town The sound comes way out here; Sister Mandy's playin' somethin' On the organ sweet and clear  There's a mocking bird a singin' In the tree out there, The brook's a gurglin' soft and low But I don't care.  All I want to hear is that sweet voice A echoin' thru the boughs, Pretty Nellie Master's voice  'A callin' home the cows.  Mother says she's been a callin' me To bring her up some wood, Says she don't know what come over me, I've always been so good.  'Bout hearin'. But I just can't hear everything Around that bloomin' house, 'Specially when the neighbors Are 'a callin home the cows. 
When the evening shadows fall Darkly over the crowded street , From the nursery , through the hall , Comes the sound of little feet. Sweet the hour at close of day , When my baby comes to me, Putting all her toys away , Climbing eager to my knee . Presses tender lips to mine , Nestles fondly on my breast ; Loving arms about me twine --- How she loves to be caress'd ! Little hands so warm and soft ; Sweet brown eyes and tresses , too ; Cooing voice that murmurs oft , "Mamma , mamma , I do love 'oo!" Oh! my precious little girl--- Priceless gift you are to me ! Earth affords no richer pearl , Life and love abound in thee.
There dawns again a glad New Year, A year of love and duty; It bounds across the hills of time, Aglow with mystic beauty.  Into the shadows of the past, The old year has departed; And now upon a rose -strewn way The bright New Year has started.  The doubts and fears of "yesterdays, " With all the care and sorrow, For ever more are swallowed up In New Year's hopeful morrow.
The lilacs and the apple trees Are all in lovely bloom; The balmy air is fragrant with The flowers' sweet perfume.  The winds breathe softest music Among the flowers and leaves; The hallelujah chorus Is wafted on the breeze;  For merry birds are singing Through all the livelong day; All nature thrills with gladness This charming month of May.  The orchards and the meadows, The brooks that ripple by, The grasses and the flowers, The lovely deep blue sky.  The little insects creeping, All join with glad accord In showing forth the beauty, And praises of the Lord.  Shall human tongues be silent While nature's voice doth sing? Ah! no, let every mortal A grateful anthem sing. 
Here on this festal day Our hearts are light and free, The clouds have rolled away, And shines fair liberty.  CHORUS.  Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah for the flag, The bonny, bonny blue! Hurrah! Hurrah! for the flag! Through which the bullets flew!  All praise to Thee, O God, All praise to Thee who broke The fetters and the rod Of slavery's galling yoke. CHORUS  All honor to the true, The men who fought and died, The boys who wore the blue Their country's love and pride. CHORUS  We honor, too, the men Who steered the ship of State, They gave their tongue and pen To stay the hand of fate.  The women too must share The glory of this day It is their answered prayer,  The clouds are rolled away. СHORUS. 
A story of the butter  And a story of the fly. Would give you comprehension, If someone would reply.  The fly was on the butter And the butter on the fly: If the butter had the wings on it It couldn't help but fly.  They say the little wooly worm, Or caterpillar spry—- That creeps along the trees of shade, Make every butter-fly.  Now, if he makes the butterfly He ought to be a fly: But if he hasn't got the wings, Where does the butterfly?  On buckwheat cakes, hot biscuits, On batter cakes, in pies; This pun is understanding The fly in butterflies.
Shakespeare wuz a poet, Dat had a pop'lar name, I recken eberybody Hab heard ob his great fame.  He useter talk 'bout honor An 'writ erbout hit's worth, Said a good name wuz better Dan enyting on earth.  Said houses, lands, an' all sich t'ings Yas! I t'ink he took in cash,— W'an't de objec' ob dis life, He simply called 'em trash.  He eben went far 'nuff ter say. An ' bout hit he wuz sho', By takin' al' his wealth fum him Yer couldn't make 'im po.'  "De precious jewel uv my sol' Am ma name "he useter squall, "An' him dat steals dat 'way fum me Hab robbed me uv my all."  I hate ter spute dat gent'mun, Er call to him to halt Hits mighty strange fer me ter be Wid him a findin' fault.  But ef he wuz libin' now An' seen t'ings mov' erlong, An' seen des what's a-gwine on, He'd sing ernudder song.  Dat t'ing is dun been turned eroun', De name am now de trash, An' ter make one po' in dis good day You're got ter steal his cash. 
It is so good to be alive; To have deep dreams; to greatly strive Through the day's work; to dance and sing Between the times of sorrowing To have a clear faith in the end That death is life's best, trustful friend.  To be alive-to hear and see This wonderful, strange pageantry Of earth, in which each hour's session Brings forth a new unknown procession Of joys- stars, flowers, seas and grass, In ever new guise before me pass.  To have deep dreams -ah me, ah me, To bring far things close by to see; To have my voyaging soul explore Beyond my body's ponderous door. To make my love from a thousand graces, Seen in a thousand women's faces.  To greatly strive-perform my share Of work-for the world grows more fair To him who measures time and fate By what his laboring days create For work is the voice that lifts to God The adoration of the sod.  To dance and sing-my body's praise For being fair in many ways. It hath no other voice than this To thank God for a moment's bliss When art and heaven together trust Joy to the perfection of the dust.  Times of sorrowing yea, to weep To wash my soul with tears, and keep It clean from earth's too constant gain, Even as a flower needs the rain To cool the passion of the sun, And takes a fresh new glory on.  To have clear faith:--through good and ill We but perform some conscious will Higher than man's. The world at best In all things doth but manifest That God has set his eternal seal Upon the unsubstantial real. 
I have named you Malaguéna,    Malaguéna, Malaguéna Though your eyes have never burned me, Nor your lips have spake, and turned me    In a whirl of mad delight. But the many stars that whisper    In the night, And the vagrant winds that lisper    Through the day In the music of my dreams have learned to play    Malaguéna, Malaguéna--  All things name you, Malaguéna,    Malaguena, Malaguéna Birds that sing in rangeless rapture, And the glory that we capture    From the coronated rose: All the passion in the ocean's    Ebbs and flows; Ah, they fill me with emotions    Hot as flame When I seek you in the shadow of a name,    Malaguéna, Malaguéna!  When I meet you, Malaguéna,    Malaguéna, Malaguéna Shall we stop and gaze in wonder? Nav, like winds that meet in thunder    We will close in tight embrace, And my kisses flash like lightning    On your face; Then our souls will feel the tightning    Each to each, Till remoulded into one they break in speech,    Malaguéna, Malaguéna! 
My heart can tell them, every one, The messengers of dreams that run Above the tree -tops in the sun.  Whether of great or little worth They carry the heart's desires forth East and west and south and north.  I know the night will close them in—- And they will meet the tempest's din—- Ere they come to that far -off inn.  The inn that stands on the bourne ofhope, Where Fear and Delight together cope For victory on a little slope.  My heart can tell them, every one, The returning messengers that run Above the tree tops-in the sun.  
A mighty temple raised in the air,    With piles of jewels, heaps of stone, Ionic columns large and fair      And great Diana on her throne --  Such splendor did Demetrius Bestow on ancient Ephesus. And this was once the glorious scene      Of miles on miles of gilded things; But now where once a famous queen     Did reign, dull Silence sits and sings; Of all the pomp that once was known  Scarce lingers now one stone on stone.           Once here on this benighted spot     Whose living live less than its dead, A multitude did pray and plot,      Urged on by what a preacher said; And men before God's throne did fall When once they heard the words of Paul. A heathen emperor's stern behest,     Seven Christian brothers doomed to die, Two hundred years in Coelian's breast,     No thought of time that flitted by-- Such was the wonder of the spell These youth awoke one day to tell. A kingdom of the ancient world,     The arms of Persia and of Rome, Ten thousand souls to Hades hurled,     And a world-conqueror's dream of home-- Such glory once the world did see; But Alexander-- where is he? And where is all the mighty host      That on Olympus sang and strove?  Where are the gods those peaks did boast?     Where now is Dian? Where is Jove? All- all in Time's great bosom sleep; Such secrets doth Oblivion keep. 
I have drunk in the fullest measure      The draught of the Demon's flesh-wine, And over the wrecks of my pleasure     The lights of the lower world shine; And now here to-night I am thinking       Of all the dark paths I have trod, And I hate all the sin and the sinking      And want to go back to my God. I am tired of the night and its yearnings,      I am tired of the pain in my breast; I am weary of jealousy's burnings,     And am longing for quiet and rest; For the pain in my prison is pressing Me down, and the Tempter is there--- I want to go back to the blessing     And breath of a holier air. O heart, you and I are but lovers ,     And we love in the human way; Even now in the darkness there hovers     Around us the light of they day; But we know just as sure as that gladness     Is up in the heaven on high, That our sinning is folly and madness     And will bring its despair by and by  So to-night while our warm hearts are beating     And our blood surges up hot and bold, While we once again are repeating      The story ten thousand years old, May our hearts be uplifted, united,     May the flesh see the fate it deserves, May our love in its richness be lighted      By the best in ourselves that it serves. I am weary of envy and sinning,     I am weary of fever and strife,  I turn myself now to the winning     Of the best and the noblest in life; What is better than love at its purest?     What is worse than the love of the sod? And the love that is firmest and surest      Is the love that is nearest God.

Caesar's memory dust shall be While the world still honors thee! Many another boasted name, Grasping at eternal fame, In forgotten dust shall lie, Barren of our memory! With the people one, thy face Mirrors all our human race! Deep within its soul, thy mind Lives forever with mankind. Age on age, thou man of men, Gives thee common life again. Caesar's kindred all must die, Thou hast immortality!
We hail thee, valiant chieftain from the West! Lo! twenty years we've seen thee dare to be A knight! Tho' some might stoop to sly necromancy For power in statehood, still thy soul's high quest Was honor for the land thine honor blessed, And justice for her sons of every degree. Branding great wrongs and false "diplomacy," Crusader, thou hast served thy country best! The race must die that hath no noble men; Ideals, not idols, make a people great! "Do justice, tho' the heavens fall!" again The Roman call that roused the listless state Thou sound'st, and, crying: "Shame to give men less!" Hast put thy race on trial by nobleness.
I am the Smoke King I am black! I am swinging in the sky, I am wringing worlds awry; I am the thought of the throbbing mills, I am the soul of the soul-toil kills, Wraith of the ripple of trading rills; Up I’m curling from the sod, I am whirling home to God; I am the Smoke King I am black.  I am the Smoke King, I am black! I am wreathing broken hearts, I am sheathing love’s light darts; Inspiration of iron times Wedding the toil of toiling climes, Shedding the blood of bloodless crimes— Lurid lowering ’mid the blue, Torrid towering toward the true, I am the Smoke King, I am black.  I am the Smoke King, I am black! I am darkening with song, I am hearkening to wrong! I will be black as blackness can— The blacker the mantle, the mightier the man! For blackness was ancient ere whiteness began. I am daubing God in night, I am swabbing Hell in white: I am the Smoke King I am black.  I am the Smoke King I am black! I am cursing ruddy morn, I am hearsing hearts unborn: Souls unto me are as stars in a night, I whiten my black men—I blacken my white! What’s the hue of a hide to a man in his might? Hail! great, gritty, grimy hands— Sweet Christ, pity toiling lands! I am the Smoke King I am black. 
For many long years you have been my friend, Faithful, unswerving and true, And when others have mocked and rejected me Safe comfort I've found in you.  Oft through the day and oft in the night, When trouble loomed darkly around, I have fled to your arms and forever and aye Unmeasured peace have I found.  If I journey by land or travel at sea, No matter how long I sojourn,  When I'm back at home you give me a seat, And welcome with warmth my return.  The world offers this and the world offers that, But nowhere such rest have I known As that which I find when you bear me up, And I sit like a king on his throne.  Vexatious inquiries you never make, And you never my thoughts disturb, And whenever I wish to fall asleep My wishes you don't try to curb.  I have known you so long and I love you so well That by the eternal I swear That nothing but death shall part me from you, My dutiful study chair! 
Wife, I's been down to de city, An' I's come back home to stay, Whar de sunshine loves to lingah And de robins sing all day.

Our President, Our President, A mighty man is He! His like on all the thrones of earth We could not hope to see.  Our nation is, our nation is  A little babe to Him; He pets us soft or spanks us hard, According to His whim.  With vision rare, with vision rare He sweeps the future wide, And then sits down and writes a note About "Race Suicide."  When Parker's charge, when Parker's charge Created quite a stir, With chattering teeth our Ruler wrote: "You're a base liar, Sir."  When Bowen said, when Bowen said That Loomis had turned a trick, Our Ruler sent a line to say: "Step down and out right quick."  Some Boston men, some Boston men Were given an interview, And when they said what He had said, He wrote: "That isn't true."  B. Storer's wife, B. Storers ' wife One day to the Vatican went, And then this note: "Come back! Come back!" Our Ruler to B. S. sent.  He sent some men, He sent some men To dig the Isthmian door; And then He went to see Himself, And then-He wrote some more.  "Our spelling's bad, our spelling's bad," Said Andrew C. one day, And then for "Spelling Simplified," He wrote without delay.  The Negro troops, the Negro troops Got on a tare one night, And then he stayed up all night long Ten thousand words to write!  Oh, yes, Oh, yes! Oh, yes, Oh, yes! He's a mighty man, I know And when he takes His pen in hand Somebody's got to go! 
Up the long hill atoiling, From dawn till set of sun, And O that I knew, my Master, What waits me when toil is done.  Before me the hill,looms darkly, My steps few joys attend, Forgive me, O my Master, But I would that I knew the end.  Am I to plod on through darkness To darkness deeper yet? Is there to be no morning When my last sun is set?  Out of the dark comes the answer. Faith speaks - O my soul, be still! The light of eternal morning Is shining beyond the hill! 
I make my bed of roses sweet! I scorn the frowns of envious Fate! I will my careless song repeat While 'round may surge contending hate! For life is what we make it still, And I am master of my will. Then let me quaff life's nectar wine And live, a lord, the passing hour; The world, and all therein, is mine, Of fame or wealth or transient power; For he, indeed, is all supreme Whose dream of life is all a dream.
A dandy looking drummer    While in a Southern town Was accosted by a bootblack    Of complexion dusky brown; Whose crownless hat and patches    Was a puzzle to behold, And how they stayed upon him    Is a mystery untold.  Said the bootblack, "Have er shine, Boss?    Only cost a haf a dime, And your shoes will take your picture    In about three minutes' time." Soon the bargain was completed    And quite soon the work was done, Then the drummer with the bootblack    Thought to have a bit of fun.  Said he, "Jake, I cannot pay you    For my purse I've failed to bring. How'd you like to take in payment   This expensive diamond ring?" Then with weird and comic gestures,    With intense affected pride, And with sparkling eyes triumphant   Jake in cunning tones replied:  "Go' long, Boss, an' quit yer foolin,'    Aain't gwi' do no sich a thing, 'Cause de police sho to 'rest me     Ef dev ketch me wid dat ring. 'Cause dey sho gwi' say I stoled it    Jes to take somewhere to sell. Dev kin see I didn't buy it     Rags an' diamonds don't match well."  "No! no! Boss, jes keep dat diamond    Fer hard luck some other time; All I axes ub you, mistah,    Gib ter me ma haf a dime. 
Come, boys! there's a call to arms.  Our country needs our and  Don't think of home and loved ones,  Come, fall in the grade   You know the fathers of this land  Who died that she be free  Are looking for us to uphold  The flag of Liberty   And so they did etch noble black  Went forth to face the foe,  Whose heart was light for country's cause  While home was desolate with woe   Loved ones praved to God above.  To spite them with His might.  That they return with honor  To their home and land of right  And God did spare that noble band  To return to home and friends.  They are an honor to their race  They stand like noble men.   Back to regular duty,  Stationed here and there,  Though in the service of Uncle Sam  Not welcomed anywhere.   What means this feeling of hatred?  Are we not one of this country’s sons? Have we not done our duty,  Each and every one?   Well, we'll not complain, comrades,  Our forefathers suffered before:  We'll do our duty like soldiers  As they did in days of yore.  But remember there's a bitter feeling That is moving through the land And no matter whatever happens We will stand un man for me.  From Washington came the order To the 25th Infantry renowned You will move with the battalion And  be stationed at Fort Brown  It was on the night of the 12th [Illegible]  While de tending then iives of Brownsville [Illegible] [Illegible stanza]  The shooting, then became general,  Each man's life was in his hands;  On the [date] of August, at Brownsville,  Came a sorrow o'er this land.  Then came the investigation  Ordered by the Commander-in-Chief,  To bring to a Southern bar for trial.  To add more to their grief   “Now tell who did the shooting  And how it all begun;"  But not one word escaped their lips That noble band stood mum.   Well, if you will shield the guilty  Your fame as soldiers is erased:  You are discharged, every man of you,  Dishonored and disgraced.  Ah but who can say dishonor . In the land of toil and strife, When men stand by their comrades For the protection of their life.  In justice to their comrades, In justice to their home, We'll await that final tribunal When God sits on His throne.  All hail the power of Jesus's name, Let angels prostrate fall: Bring forth the royal diadem And crown Him Lord of all."
Just a tiny little dewdrop, In a tiny little cell, And, although it spoke no language Far as common folk could tell Yet by means of unseen conduits, Built by Nature to the soul From the crystal little dewdrop, What awondrous message stole!  He who sent the crystal dewdrop That bedecks the petal rare, Like a tiny ball of beauty Nestling on its bosom fair, Will reward each faithful worker, When the day of life shall close, With a crown that gleams in splendor Like the dewdrop on the rose. 
Like the page on which we write, Every day comes spotless white    From the Great Unseen:  Let us use the hours with care, That no blurs the scroll may bear    But a record clean. 
There was a young man named Frye, Who on his eye had a sty. He got in his gig, Went and bought him a pig To put in the sty on his eye!  There was a young man of Pauline, Who bought a new sewing machine. Said he: "This will do To sow my oats, too;" The farmer, you know, was quite green.  The old game rooster bowed low To a hen; then said: "I'm your beau." Said the hen of his choice: "I don't like your voice, For it sounds too much like a crow!"  There was a young woman of Lee, Who had a shape like a "b"; One day 'twas too bad! She dropped off her pad, And her shape was like "L," you could see! 
Gone are the roses that blossomed While the withered buds remain, Greedily hugging their sweetness Till the very thought gives pain.  Gone are the souls that blossomed, While the withered buds remain Eagerly grasping life's blessings, Nor giving them back again.  What to the world is the flower That fills not the air with its scent? What to the world is the creature Whose life for himself is spent?
Noise of hammers once I heard, Many hammers, busy hammers, Beating, shaping, night and day, Shaping, beating dust and clay To a palace; saw it reared; Saw the hammers laid away.  And I listened, and I heard Hammers beating, night and day, In the palace newly reared, Beating it to dust and clay, Other hammers, muffled hammers, Silent hammers of decay.
Human life is naught but vapor, Tossed and driven as the haze Fleeting as the breath of flowers Or the dews on Autumn maize; 'Tis a hill midst thorns and thistles That the pilgrim's bound to scale, And in climbing toward the summit, Some will win and some must fail.  Life's a brook whose sweetest music Lulls the fainting soul to sleep, And its lullaby entrancing Through the love-lit valleys sweep. Truly life's amighty ocean, With its hurricanes and death, While both weeping maids and mothers Linger near with faltering breath.  Somewhere life had its beginning, As the streams that glide along In the sunshine of the morning, Singing oft a happy song. And this life will have its ending As the sun at vesper goes, When the veil of night is dropping Noiseless to its long repose. 
De chillun all wuz grinnin', An' ev'ything wuz bright; 'Cause we alluz had a good time When grandpa spent de night.  Whenevah mama started To say a word to us, Den grandpa he would pitch in An' make a great big fuss.  He'd alluz bring us candy, Apples an' ground-peas, too, An' he'd give 'em to us chillun To me an' Dave and Sue.  Dere'd be sump'n fo' baby Peaches er sump'n good Ouah grandpa was de bes' man In all de neighborhood.  Ef he give de babe a nickel, Dat sho ' would start a fight, 'Cause each one wanted money, When grandpa spent de night.  De neighbors' chilluns come in—- To see 'em wuz a sight 'Cause ev'ybody knowed when Ouah grandpa spent de night.  Dem good old days is vanished Dey's all done passed away, An, a wooden slab is standin' Above whar grandpa lay.  Each time I git to thinkin' Uv me an' him apart, A little bit er sadness Comes creepin' in my heart.  An' den de angel whispers "Jes' keep yo' soul pure white, An' den you'll wake some mawnin' Whar grandpa spends de night!" 
When shall my hand and heart be free To try the far off heights of Fame, On her fair page to write my name And shine till Time shall cease to be?  When shall my soul take wings and mount To that proud shrine where Glory stands, And beckons me with willing hands, To come and lave me at her fount?  I cannot gain the means to rise, Denied am I the right to soar, Because I'm black, because I'm poor Would men their fellowman despise?  And yet There is my natural bent, I have the gift in endles flow, I have the will to make it glow, But cruel Fate will not consent.  And so I move as doth a ball, Upon the bosom of the tide, Unable its own course to guide, Obeys the ever -breaking squall.  But lest my years for naught be spent In drifting aimless o'er the tide, I'll wrest the rudder of my pride And steer Life's barque to where 'tis bent. 
The poet pens with busy brain A joyous little song; He reads it o'er and o'er again, It cheers his soul along. How often a wounded heart it heals, To the sad and lone brings mirth, But the ecstacy that the poet feels Is greater than wealth of earth.  The sculptor sees in the rugged stone, Beauties that few may see, He chisels away with his thoughts alone To set that beauty free. Would the sculptor barter his soul's delight When he views that finished mold, For a king's vast wealth or a monarch's might Or aught that the world might hold?  Soft music's strain may charm the ear Of the listener all intent, Then he seems to feel his heaven near And his soul filled with content. But he who sets that music free Its ecstacy can tell, Within his soul there joy can be Where the Infinite may dwell.  Within some household, lone and still, Some humble one may move, Who quietly doeth the Master's will And every wrong reprove. The skilled musician, poet, all, May know of higher life; But ecstacy rules in this hall, This home that knows not strife. 
I stood 'neath the boughs of the slender oaks At the dawn of a fair spring day, As the golden king his rays dispatched O'er the landscape far away.  I watched the radiant, sparkling beams As they tripped through the dew-kissed trees, While the birds in one melodious strain Kept time to the rippling breeze.  Each outstretched field and stately hill Was adorned in gorgeous green, And the air was filled with fragrance rare From the flowers that blushed unseen.  The shamrock peeped from its tiny cell To salute the new -born day, And the swift -winged bee stole a gentle sip From the wild flowers by the way.  The gray squirrel whisked through the forest boughs With a heart that was light and gay, While the snow -fleeced lambs on the green hillsides Took turns in their childlike play.  The sparkling stream with its merry din Ran nimbly over its bed, And the wild spring flowers waved a parting kiss, Then blushed to a crimson red.  I stood with rapt'rous wonder stunned, And thought of the Powerful Hand That had brought into being this marvelous host To enliven the beauteous land.  I came again at the eventide; The sun was sinking low; His fading beams like a fleeting life Had lost all their noonday glow.  Each field and hill lay brown and bare, Which once had been decked in green; The trees of their foliage had been bereft— Not a floweret gay could be seen.  No music rang through the forest boughs, No sweet melodious chime; The songsters, pierced by the chilling blast, Had flown to a fairer clime.  Through tears I scanned the once strong oaks That had stood for many ayear, And I thought them a glimpse of our human life When the close of our days is near.  But, ah! at the close of our day of life, We from the grave shall ascend; For the Powerful Hand that gave us birth  Will be with us still in the end.  
Princess of fortune, fads and chance,    Beau Brummels of the present day,   Sir Knights who don the sword and lance,    And bravely join the martial fray, Ye swear by all your gods, they say,    Your castles have no counterpart: Harken to this refrain I pray     I know a paradise apart!  Ye cads who prate with nonchalance    And ribald raptures oft display, Dashing devotees of the dance    In which you madly whirl and sway, Your pleasures are of yesterday,    Mere relics of a waning art. For pleasures that defy dismay    I know a paradise apart.  Daughters whom beauty doth enhance,    Nimrods seeking their nimble prey, Heroines of some sad romance,    The poor, the rich, in grand array, Each wanders in his wonted way,    In blind pursuit of pleasure's mart, To Eden's doomed decay    I know a paradise apart.  L'ENVOI.  Prince, where the brooklet winds it way,    Where Nature's balm revives the heart In woodland green, in woodland grey--    I know a paradise apart. 
Oh! happy youth, before whose feet The pathway lies both straight and fair, How little doth thou really know Of days and nights o'er rough with care.  Thy dreams are sweet, thy thought doth make A picture of those coming years, Where joys and smiles forever dwell And thy young eyes condemned with tears.  The ceaseless flow of time goes on For young and old alike, I mean, And life is heavy with its load Years have held, the eyes have not seen.  The brow is furrowed with many a line, The heart grows dull with pain and grief; And Death at last, with kindly hand, Draws the curtain, and brings relief.
As twilight marked the closing day    And all was still, I looked upon the fading scene    And felt the thrill Of birds that sang their vesper hymns   In doleful strain; And then the thoughts of my lost love    Filled me with pain. I thought of how we used to love    In days of yore, Before she sighed and told me that    Our love was o'er; I long to see her smiling face    And hear her voice That always bade me not to weep,    But rather to rejoice.  The man that claims her as a bride,    Has left me bare He can but love and idolize    A gem so rare, But as I think of my sad fate     I wish me dead, Because I gave my heart's best love    To the girl he wed. 
Twas in the gloaming , deep in forest shade When shadows darken, and the ghost, unlaid, Wrapping himself about in garments white Prepares to stalk away into the night. Above, the jewelled canopy stretched out Piercing the sable gloom of Erebus; And darkness summoning her couriers fleet Each hastily despatched on errands meet.  The herdsman in his cheerful cot hard-by Offered a sample prayer to Him on high. His fare was poor---a dish of pulse, some bread,--- Yet he was happier than if better fed. Each day his hands their humble task essayed; At even-tide he felt himself well-paid.  The rich man in his palace on the hill His larder filled with trophies of the kill; His cellars overflowed with rich old wine,--- Old Rhenish, which was mellowed much by time. No prayer, no word of thanks , came from his mouth; Even to bow his head the man was loath.  The hermit sat before his cheerless board Scanning with glut'nous eyes his glittering hoard. To him it was a feast, a feast indeed; For other food than this he felt no need. And thus the miser sat through half the night, Basking in his treasure's reflected light .  Down in the vale in still sequestered nook A farmhouse nestled near the purling brook; And through the half dim light a pace before Behold the genial farmer in the door! Within the busy house-wife bustled 'round Spreading the homely board with viands sound, With herbs, maize bread and other wholesome messes, Which soon the jovial good -man warmly blesses.  'Tis night: Two youthful lovers thread the mountain path, Waking the slumb'ring Echo with each laugh. Some ancient jest the jocund swain essayed,--- With trilling laughter then replied the maid: " Kind sir , when first mine ears thou didst assail, With ever ready wit and pleasing tale, Methought that ne'er before was swain so bright, Who could with minstrel speech surpass the knight. But now, most valiant sir, I must confess That common usage under-rates the best---" "And like enow 'tis true,' observed the lad, 'Abuses make the very best, seem bad."  'Tis late : The Great Bear in the sky begins to fade, My Reverie is broken---the Muse is fled. A roseate hue the misty East o'erspreads Pronouncing blessings on each sleepiug head. The Dreamer rose, the tolling bell said one, Aurora, Herald of the Dawn, had come.
I love to sit in a shady park, When evening's sun is sinking low, Amid the landscape's ruddy glow, And hear my spaniel's honest bark.  Brave, patient, faithful, gentle friend, With pendent ears and snowy breast, The shrine of feelings unexpressed, My heart to you I would commend.  I look into your lustrous eyes, As soft and clear as some limpid stream, And wonder, can the inward gleam Bespeak a soul that never dies?  The agony of feelings mute, Of thoughts too deep for human tongue, That mock all effort to be sung Is this, too, shared by the stolid brute?  No stunted growths in Nature's schemes? No cruel tyranny of Fate, That fiction base of ancient date, To cheat us of our golden dreams?  And he, "the brute of slight remove," Now sweetly called the Nation's "child," May he, too, hold a vision wild A humble chance his worth to prove?  Why toss him, then, as a worthless toy? His manhood rights from him why steal? Why take from him fair Freedom's seal? Why crush the soul of a Negro boy? 
    There is a joy A feeling sweet without alloy,     That fills the soul When Autumn skies their beauties roll     Before the eyes. With splendors rich in sweet surprise;     When plants and flow`rs, Which Summer sun and gentle show'rs     Had clothed in green, In brighter garments may be seen,     In tints and hues, Which glisten in the morning dews.      The verdant vine, Whose tangled tresses neatly line     The ugly gap That storm has made in Nature's lap.     Resplendent shows. When Autumn's breath upon it blows.     The shady seat, Where Comfort sought relief from heat     In noonday hour, When Phoebus beamed in greatest pow'r,     Now sweetly woos By beauties rich which Autumn strews.      	No dark'ning cloud, With lightning forked and thunder loud,     Now brings its fright, As o'er the sky it rolls in might.     No drenching rain, In ruthless torrents poured amain,     Claims as its spoil The tardy fruits of farmer's toil.     When Summer sped, These dread attendants also fled,     In deep alarm At golden Autumn's peaceful charm.      As Autumn sun In less'ning circles makes its run,     The ev'ning shade, Of ever length'ning shadows made,     Brings sweet increase To hours when Nature sleeps in peace.     O'er field and hill, Whose products feed the busy mill,     The silent Night, With chilling touches soft and light,     Distils her dews, Whose teeming show'r the turf renews.      In grove and field, The Summer labors find their yield     In grain and fruits, And healthful herbs and tuber roots.     The grateful swain, As slowly creaks the brimming wain     With Nature's store, Deplores his toilsome lot no more;     But Autumn's boon He garners yet, till Harvest Moon,     With mellow light, A soft effulgence pours o'er Night.        His labors done, The farmer takes his dog and gun,     To bring dismay To timid hare and squirr'l at play.     The cautious quail He now pursues o'er grassy trail     To bushy close, Where covey feeds in deep repose.      With fluttered whir, A dozen wings the air bestir,     And tempt the shot That drops its victims to the spot.      With quickened pace, The farmer hies him from the chase     When daylight fades, And ev'ning, settling o'er the glades,     Shields from his aim The feathered tributes it would claim.     With pouch well filled, And aching limbs, fatigued and chilled.     He greets the spot Where dimly stands his little cot,     Before whose fire He sweetly rests the night entire.      What sweeter joy, When Autumn dullness tends to cloy,     To find relief In sports that bring not Nature grief:     To range the hills For treasures rich that Autumn spills.     Yet bring no harm To timid forms that take alarm:     To show as spoil, When ev'ning ends the thrilling toil,     No lives annoyed. Nor yet in wantonness destroyed.  
O Father, God of the universe wide! Humbly, lo these many years , have we prayed To Thee that hand of injustice be stayed, And, that a Christ-led world ever abide In peace, doing right unto men of dark Skin as to proud Lucifer, who reckons That the Star of Hope beams for, nor beckons None save whose face doth bear Noah's mark.  Shall we, Lord, continue to suffer hate The many wrongs that manhood debase, damn Lives of them Thou divinely did create, With skin a darker hue, for son of Ham, Than Lucifer, or, remembering gyves, Cease to ornate with patience humble lives?  In ten million breasts is nursed the hope, Flickering like candle-light though it be, Through divine dispensation we may grope From out our segregated sphere and see, Beyond years of transgression , some token Of the promised mercy Thou hath spoken.  Merciful God, we know not now Thy will, But as in the past, so in days to come; Throughout all the long waiting years, until Reason be dethroned complete, will we hum The solacing words, "Thy will be done here As Above," while Thy wrath we pray and fear.
I know a little human weakness    That hesitates man's best intention, And since days of Eden, long ago,    This weakness has caused much contention.  Covetiveness, cruel, cold and sordid,    Blind men to needs of next door neighbor— 'Tis a weakness blighting many lives,    Makes gold the end for which men labor.     I know a little rule for living,     And since it first to me was given, When yet but a child of tender years,    This rule to keep have I ever striven.  Do ye unto others as thou wouldst    That all men do even unto you So runs this simple, blessed rule, best    For the guidance of our whole lives through.
Little maid of gentle mien, In all the wide, wide world, I ween There beats no kinder, purer heart Than thine, so free from guile and art, My own sweet girl, Elizabeth.  Thou hast the charm, loved one, that lies In wavy locks and shining eyes; But, God be thanked that in thy face I find a more than earthly grace;— My noble girl, Elizabeth!  Serene, sincere, unselfish, true A glimpse of Heaven in thee I view; Thy presence chases care away And turns the darkest night to day, My daughter dear, Elizabeth.  I ask not that the future bring The things whose praises worldlings sing: Nor wealth, nor name, nor power e'en These gifts of earth I count too mean To crave for thee, Elizabeth.  God keep thee through the coming days, Let modest worth crown all thy ways; To serve where needed be thy aim; Thy goal the truth, instead of fame I pray for thee, Elizabeth.
There's a Sampson lying, sleeping in the land,  He shall soon awake, and with avenging hand,  In an all unlocked for hour,  He will rise in mighty power;  What dastard can his righteous rage withstand?   E'er since the chains were riven at a stroke,  E'er since the dawn of Freedom's morning broke,  He has groaned, but scarcely uttered,  While his patient tongue ne'r muttered,  Though in agony he bore the galling yoke.   O, what cruelty and torture has he felt?  Could his tears, the heart of his oppressor melt?  In his gore they bathed their hands,  Organized and lawless bands-—  And the innocent was left in blood to welt.   The mighty God of Nations doth not sleep,  His piercing eye its faithful watch doth keep,  And well nigh His mercy's spent,  To the ungodly lent:  "They have sowed the wind, the whirlwind they shall reap."   From His nostrils issues now the angry smoke,  And asunder bursts the all-oppressive yoke;  When the prejudicial heel  Shall be lifted, we shall feel,  That the hellish spell surrounding us is broke.   The mills are grinding slowly, slowly on,  And till the very chaff itself is gone;  Our cries for justice louder,  'Till oppression's ground to powder —  God speed the day of retribution on!   Fair Columbia's filmy garments all are stained;  In her courts is blinded justice rudely chained;  The black Sampson is awaking,  And his fetters fiercely breaking;  By his mighty arm his rights shall be obtained.  
When I hear a youth expand, "I have such an ideal friend," I think, while I silent keep, Just another dreamer sleep.  When I hear a youth say, "He Sore has disappointed me," I think, ere the next word spoke, Just another sleeper woke.  When I hear a youth declare, Men are friendly-friends are rare," Then I open wide my eyes, For I know that youth is wise. 
There are heroes in the great beyond Whose names no history tells; There are many in the vast unknown Whose praise no charms swells.  There are fathers who have fought alone, Alone in rain or sun, But by their toils, which few will own, Great, victories have been won.  The mothers who have suffered much That others might be blest, Yea, legion is the name of such, Whose deeds are unconfessed.  The mountain cave may be the spot, The valley hut the place Where, in the peasant's lodge or cot Is hid a hero's face.  Beauty has lived whose perfect grace A Raphael's virgin vied; No artist drew the lovely face, His colors lie untried.  Birds and flowers have passed away Whose matins and whose bloom No human ear has caught the lay, No mortal the perfume.  Some one deserved the laurel wreath Another's brow adorns, But lo, he fainted in the heath, Beneath a crown of thorns.  Some one, some where, in times of need Has righted divers wrongs No poet words his noble deed, No minstrel sings his songs.  The songs unsung, and deeds untold, The beauty still unfound; The lambs who never knew a fold The heroes left uncrowned.  They number more than tongue can tell As each age adds its store, While years and months the army swell, And still there's more and more.   'Tis not the brush, nor verse, nor song, Nor homage of the clan That helps humanity along— The ACTION makes the man.  However secret be the place Of duties performed well, God's book of records none erase Eternity will tell. 
Oh, come, Love, let us take a walk Down the Way of Life together; Storms may come, but what care we If be fair or foul the weather!  When the skies are blue o'er head, Balmy, scented winds will after Us, adown the valley blow Haunting echoes of our laughter!  Tho' Life's storms upon us beat, Crushing us with dark disaster, All their raging may not drown Ringing echoes of our laughter.  So we'll tread the Way of Life, You and I, Love, both together; Storm, or sunshine, happy we, If be foul or fair the weather. 
Not o'er thy dust let there be spent The gush of maudlin sentiment; Such drift as that is not for thee, Whose life and deeds and songs agree, Sublime in their simplicity.  Nor shall the sorrowing tear be shed. O singer sweet, thou art not dead! In spite of time's malignant chill, With living fire thy songs shall thrill, And men shall say, "He liveth still!"  Great poets never die, for Earth Doth count their lives of too great worth To lose them from her treasured store: So shalt thou live for evermore Though far thy form from mortal ken Deep in the hearts and minds of men.
When you and I were young, the days Were filled with scent of pink and rose, And full of joy from dawn till close, From morning's mist till evening's haze. And when the robin sung his song The verdant woodland ways along, We whistled louder than he sung. And school was joy, and work was sport For which the hours were all too short, When you and I were young, my boy, When you and I were young.  When you and I were young, the woods Brimmed bravely o'er with every joy To charm the happy-hearted boy. The quail turned out her timid broods; The prickly copse, a hostess fine, Held high black cups of harmless wine; And low the laden grape-vine swung With beads of night-kissed amethyst Where buzzing lovers held their tryst, When you and I were young, my boy, When you and I were young.  When you and I were young, the cool And fresh wind fanned our fevered brows When tumbling o'er the scented mows, Or stripping by the dimpling pool, Sedge-fringed about its shimmering face, Save where we 'd worn an ent'ring place. How with our shouts the calm banks rung! How flashed the spray as we plunged in,— Pure gems that never caused a sin! When you and I were young, my boy, When you and I were young.  When you and I were young, we heard All sounds of Nature with delight,— The whirr of wing in sudden flight, The chirping of the baby-bird. The columbine's red bells were rung; The locust's vested chorus sung; While every wind his zithern strung To high and holy-sounding keys, And played sonatas in the trees— When you and I were young, my boy, When you and I were young.  When you and I were young, we knew To shout and laugh, to work and play, And night was partner to the day In all our joys. So swift time flew On silent wings that, ere we wist, The fleeting years had fled unmissed; And from our hearts this cry was wrung— To fill with fond regret and tears The days of our remaining years— "When you and I were young, my boy, When you and I were young." 
If life were but a dream, my Love,     And death the waking time; If day had not a beam, my Love,     And night had not a rhyme,-- A barren, barren world were this       Without one saving gleam; I 'd only ask that with a kiss       You 'd wake me from the dream.  If dreaming were the sum of days,     And loving were the bane; If battling for a wreath of bays     Could soothe a heart in pain,--       I 'd scorn the meed of battle's might,       All other aims above       I 'd choose the human's higher right,       To suffer and to love!
A BLUE -BELL springs upon the ledge , Alark sits singing in the hedge; Sweet perfumes scent the balmy air , And life is brimming everywhere . What lark and breeze and bluebird sing , Is Spring, Spring, Spring!  No more the air is sharp and cold; The planter wends across the wold, And, glad, beneath the shining sky . We wander forth,my love and I. And ever in cur hearts doth ring This song of Spring, Spring!  For life is life, and love is love, Twixt ' maid and man or dove and dove. Life may be short, life may be long, But love will come, and to its song Shall this refrain for ever cling Of Spring, Spring, Spring!
 An old man planted and dug and tended,     Toiling in joy from dew to dew;   The sun was kind, and the rain befriended;     Fine grew his orchard and fair to view.   Then he said: "I will quiet my thrifty fears,   For here is fruit for my failing years."    But even then the storm-clouds gathered,     Swallowing up the azure sky;   The sweeping winds into white foam lathered     The placid breast of the bay, hard by;   Then the spirits that raged in the darkened air   Swept o'er his orchard and left it bare.    The old man stood in the rain, uncaring,     Viewing the place the storm had swept;   And then with a cry from his soul despairing,     He bowed him down to the earth and wept.   But a voice cried aloud from the driving rain;   "Arise, old man, and plant again!"
By the stream I dream in calm delight, and watch as in a glass,   How the clouds like crowds of snowy-hued and white-robed maidens pass,   And the water into ripples breaks and sparkles as it spreads,   Like a host of armored knights with silver helmets on their heads.   And I deem the stream an emblem fit of human life may go,   For I find a mind may sparkle much and yet but shallows show,   And a soul may glow with myriad lights and wondrous mysteries,   When it only lies a dormant thing and mirrors what it sees.
A hush is over all the teeming lists, And there is pause, a breath-space in the strife; A spirit brave has passed beyond the mists And vapors that obscure the sun of life. And Ethiopia, with bosom torn, Laments the passing of her noblest born.  She weeps for him a mother's burning tears-- She loved him with a mother's deepest love He was her champion thro' direful years, And held her weal all other ends above. When Bondage held her bleeding in the dust, He raised her up and whispered, "Hope and Trust."  For her his voice, a fearless clarion, rung That broke in warning on the ears of men; For her the strong bow of his pow'r he strung And sent his arrows to the very den Where grim Oppression held his bloody place And gloated o'er the mis'ries of a race.  And he was no soft-tongued apologist; He spoke straight-forward, fearlessly uncowed; The sunlight of his truth dispelled the mist And set in bold relief each dark-hued cloud; To sin and crime he gave their proper hue, And hurled at evil what was evil's due.  Thro' good and ill report he cleaved his way Right onward, with his face set toward the heights, Nor feared to face the foeman's dread array-- The lash of scorn, the sting of petty spites. He dared the lightning in the lightning's track, And answered thunder with his thunder back.  When men maligned him and their torrent wrath In furious imprecations o'er him broke, He kept his counsel as he kept his path; 'Twas for his race, not for himself, he spoke. He knew the import of his Master's call And felt himself too mighty to be small.  No miser in the good he held was he-- His kindness followed his horizon's rim. His heart, his talents and his hands were free To all who truly needed aught of him. Where poverty and ignorance were rife, He gave his bounty as he gave his life.  The place and cause that first aroused his might Still proved its pow'r until his latest day. In Freedom's lists and for the aid of Right Still in the foremost rank he waged the fray; Wrong lived; His occupation was not gone. He died in action with his armor on!  We weep for him, but we have touched his hand, And felt the magic of his presence nigh, The current that he sent thro'out the land, The kindling spirit of his battle-cry O'er all that holds us we shall triumph yet And place our banner where his hopes were set!  Oh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore, But still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale! Thou'st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail. She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry, She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh, And rising from beneath the chast'ning rod, She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!
BEYOND the years the answer lies ,    Beyond where brood the grieving skies    And Night drops tears. Where Faith rod-chastened smiles to rise    And doff its fears, And carping Sorrow pines and dies    Beyond the years.  Beyond the years the prayer for rest Shall beat no more within the breast;    The darkness clears, And Morn perched on the mountain's crest    Her form uprears— The day that is to come is best,    Beyond the years .  Beyond the years the soul shall find That endless peace for which it pined,    For light appears, And to the eyes that still were blind     With blood and tears, Their sight shall come all unconfined    Beyond the years. 
How more than brave and passing wise ,    He holds his majesty of place!    No cringing coward of craven fears : His eye is clear; his vision lies    Beyond the prejudice of race    Beyond the surface of the years .  Strong prophet of the Ethiop    A modern Moses come to lead    A people into broader ways ; His steps are through the Gates of Hope    His life conforms unto their need    By virtue of telestic days.  And be thy prayer, oh dusky race,    A prayer that ye may follow him,    And stand where he would have ye stand! That ye may tread the master's pace,    And through rough places, gray and dim,    Emerge into the Promised Land!
I sometimes feel that life contains    Nothing, in all its wealth, to pay For half the sorrows and the pains    That haunt our day.  Ambition lures us on and on,    A dangerous and a treacherous guide! With every vict'ry that is won    Goes humbled pride!  And, still, we labor, love, and trust,    And seek to conquer as we go! We reap at last repose in dust—    Naught else we know!  We leave the gewgaws of our power,    The hearts that hate us, and adore! And after life's distressing hour—    We know no more!
An immortal name and eternal fame Are not judged by color of the skin, The true and best sign is an active mind— It is there all true greatness begins.  In the hall of fame is 'graven a name— The son of a down-trodden race ; Though of humble birth , this genius of worth In the forum of fame holds a place .  His name and song will ever live long To chase from life sorrow and strife ; Poems of praise will our voices raise Notes and lyrics of lowly life.  Then shine, bright star , on heights afar; Blaze out a sure path for all men: Thy light lose not, all else forgot; Bid them come to thee and ascend.
AS long as this race of ours shall live,    With strident voice he will be singing    Sweet songs of liberty, and bringing To his people hope, that will give    New life to each and all who may thirst,    Or who would be men among the first.  Unappreciated, long have they fought,    And valiantly for a cause that's dear    To their long despised race, far and near, And wonders have these heroes wrought    With mighty pens, now tipped with love;    Now invoking wrath of Him above.  Long after Right shall have obtained ,    Aye, after his pens shall have gone to rust ,    And mortal body mixed with the dust , May our memories live unstained    The name of him who in peace or war    Stood steadfast---the Negro Editor. 
Cheer up, faint heart, a day dawns brighter, That makes the heavy heart beat lighter, A day when light dispels the gloom, And life will seem illumined noon.  The seems dark at times , 'tis true, Our visions rise a changeless blue, We grasp, and open to behold A disappointment huge and bold.  In vain we strive our hearts to cheer , But lo escapes a painful sneer At castles built on sandy soil , For then seems life a fruitless toil .  Our friends behold us but afar , Nor do they choose a nearer view , Their doors which e'er have been ajar Are locked ; they hid us now adieu .  So seemed this heartless chilly world, When adversity makes its call, When castles built on sand are whirled, And at our feet are made to fall.
On a bright, fantastic day, In the flow'ry month of May, Whilst upon a bow'ry fair, Strolling in the morning air, Pan, of vanished days of yore, Meeting Echo, greetings bore Greetings fond and full of feeling, Modest, friendly, warm, appealing. Twas in a grove, apart, alone, In the shine of Helicon; Dapple green was nature's dress, And, amidst her loveliness, Bees around the blossoms winging And the feath'ry family singing, Fountains flowing, full and free, Told a tale of ecstasy.  "Hail, thou nymph of fair delight; Hail, deceiver of my sight, Have I met thee fast a-Maying, Full into my vision straying, Dressed in robes of pearly white, Garments dazzling to my sight?. Thou are ever still caressing Hills and vales, and dropping blessings, Murmuring voices of the air, Making merry everywhere! Come, and tell it as we go Why thou hast been timid so, Hiding 'mong the flow'rs and hills, Meads and valleys, rocks and rills, Whilst I, dwelling all alone, Roam the shine of Helicon! Thou art all in all to me, Sweet, thou nymph, Euphrosyne, And 'twill be a kind of pleasure To assist me in my leisure! We can live up in the trees, Round the blossoms, like the bees, And our gladness will be long, Smacking doubly full of song. Tell me thou wilt live with me During this eternity, In the pleasantness of hours In the middle of the bow'rs, Such as elsewhere there are none As are those of Helicon! May thou concord freely give, And with me forever live."  "I am Echo, nymph of air, Habitating everywhere, Ever wonted to be sad, Wishing ever to be glad, And I hide among the hills, Meads and valleys, rocks and rills, Whilst thou, dwelling all alone, Roam the shine of Helicon. It will be a kind of pleasure To assist thee in thy leisure; We can live up in the trees, Round the blossoms, like the bees, And our gladness will be long, Smacking doubly full of song. I will ever live with thee, During this eternity! In the night-time of the hours, These will be our nuptial bow'rs, Nymphs and Naiads will be there, And the fairy troops of air; They will all come out to see How we make solemnity, Phantoms following, tripping sweet, Sylphs and seraphs wil they meet, Fays and elves will join the ring, And assist the balancing, While we make an antic round, Treading nimbly on the ground; Then to sphery realms so soon, Some will soar up to the moon, Others, dwelling here below, To the nether worlds will go.  "Now I conjure me up the hour Through the aid of Hecate's power, And our nuptials swift beginning, Hand in hand we go a- spinning, Marking out an antic round, Treading nimbly on the ground, Nymphs and Naiads everywhere, And the fairy troops of air. Now I raise my hand on high, Pointing upward to the sky; Sprites and phantoms, take your flight Through the middle of the night, Soaring smoothly, some so soon Sit upon the corner'd moon, Others, dwelling here below, To the nether regions go. 
The little bird sits in the nest and sings A shy, soft song to the morning light; And it flutters a little and prunes its wings. The song is halting and poor and brief. And the fluttering wings scarce stir a leaf; But the note is a prelude to sweeter things, And the busy bill and the flutter slight  Are proving the wings for a bolder flight! 
Lead wisely on, thou God-appointed guide, And save thy people from corroding pride; In thy right hand their lingering hopes reside,    Lead careful on!  With confidence they cleave thy shielded side,    And follow on!  Thou who dost come to lead a bonded tribe, Dost lead with nimble speed and tak'st no bribe, Dost all the Heaven -born virtues strong imbibe, To move.it onTo thee my humble tribute I ascribe,    Pray, lead us on.  Thou, organizer of a shattered race, Eternal sunshine gilds thy godly face, We feel secure within thy firm embrace, While marching on; Thy name nor time nor memory shall erase,    Then lead us on!  Thou, benefactor to all human kind, Dost weave the cord the races all to bind, The God of Wisdom in thy head enshrined, Directs thee on;  Obeyest thou the Superhuman mind,     And leadest on. 	 Up from the yoke of slavery forced thy flight, Thou aimest ever for a greater light A Moses sent-no ill begotten night     To bear us on; Thy noble deep-grained principles unite,    And show us on.   Thou hast no time to rave at idle talk, For prudent counsel glads thy heavenly walk. And ever as astrong and prosperous bark    Thou plowest on,  With sober helm thou shootest for the mark,    Safe surging on.  Were I of keenly wit and vision bright, And could but only wield my pen aright, I'd paint the glory of the magic light,    That guides us on,  That from the deepest depths of darkest night    Directs us on.  Ye fools, who disapprove his plan today, Who now attempt to check its giant sway, Just be content to watch and see the way    He leads us on;  Immortal love his labours will repay    To lead us on.  Some day when all your gory tears are past, When nevermore you feel oppression's blast, You will rejoice to find that he at last,    Has led us on,  When at the goal of peace we anchor fast,    All clinging on.  Hail Washington! all hail, all hail to thee, The wise and loving head of Tuskegee, Who wields the parent rod of Industry    To lead us on.  Thou who would'st shape anation's destiny,     Still lead us on.
Yesterday the world was beautiful and gay, Roses and violets were blooming by the way, The tiny blue bells drank the dew, The birds sang sweetly in the leafy boughs, All nature was clad in bright array,    I walked with you.  To-day the world is dark and drear; No roses and violets to greet me by the way. The tiny bluebells are asleep, The little birds have ceased to sing; My heart is sad and lonely,    I walk alone.

Out of the darkness Out of the night, Up from slavery Into the light, Pushing straight -forward, Using his time Fighting ignorance, Defeating crime, Climbing steadily To moral heights. O Negro haters, Why curse and fight, He loves the Dear Flag, Red, White and Blue. In peace and in war He is always true. So treat him squarely, Help him to rise, A better country Will be the prize. 
Nature blushes 'neath the gaze    Of the ardent sun, Earth is teaming o'er with praise;    Summer has begun.  Birds are flitting to and fro,    Singing forth their lays, Filling all the earth around    With their notes of praise.  Roses now are open wide;    Perfume fills the air; Sunbeams kiss the lovely face    Of the lily fair.  See the dewdrops on the grass,    Sparkling in the light, When the brilliant sun appears    Chasing off the night!  What fair visitor is this    Who has come to earth, Bringing with her birds and flowers,    Love and joy and mirth?     List upon the floating breeze Comes the birdie's tune, As he answers back to me,    "'Tis the rosy June." 
Out from your homes, ye patriots all!    Ye son of Ethiope true! With hearts a-leap at the bugle call, At the line of heroes, bronzed and tall,    The brown that wears the blue; From distant Orient isles they come     Back to the mother strand. Salute them, trump and sounding drum!    Salute them, heart and hand!  Old Glory's stripes are shining red     With our good soldiers ' gore, Since Attucks fell and Salem bled, Black fighters 'neath its folds have led    The fight in every war. At Pillow and Wagner's hellish fray    On San Juan's blazing hill; And the blood that flowed at El Caney    Has drenched it deeper still.  What though an envious hate and pride    Upon us fix their bans? What though our birthright be denied? One glory they can never bide--    We are Americans! And when the dangers darkly reach    Across the nation's sky, We hurl our lives into the breach    To suffer, bleed and die.
What means that cadence, soft and low, That rises, falls, in rhythmic flow?         Hark!    From the distant plain    It sounds again.          Hark!    From yonder mountain peak    Sweet voices seem to speak,    As tho ' descending, chamois -like,    From rock to rock. What awe they strike!          Hark!  From hill and vale toward yonder wood, Where oak and ash and all have stood For years and years, defying time, They all converging seem to chime.          Hark!    Those voices, dying ne'er,    Sounding on the morning air,    Seem greater life and strength to gain    With every beat and measure of refrain.          Hark!  Blending, chiming, with sweetest harmony, That sounds like to angelic minstrelsy.    They slowly near. From forest and valley that strange chorus sounds Like the sweet, fettered voices of angels unbound,    Till at last it is here.       List!    Bird and beast and all are still;    Winding there about the hill,    E'en the stream that flows along    Stops to listen to the song.       Still!    How those voices blend and chime!    (Sweeter far than yours and mine.)    Now 'tis slow, now 'tis fast;    Now 'tis here; now 'tis past;    Then back again, and soft recede,    And almost in the distance dies away;    Then, loud and louder, as tho' freed    From all restraints; but ever, ever gay.       Hark!!!  No poet's pen, no genius ' ready tongue       Can ever limn The beauty, grandeur, splendent glory       Of that simple forest hymn. 
There were no kings of men till men Made kings of men, and of the earth; There were no privileged classes when First Nature, man and beasts, had birth.  Man was sole monarch of his sphere, And each with equal power was made; Each from the earth partook his share; Each shared with each earth's sun and shade.  No fetters on the limbs were bound; The intellect was free as light; Man's every wish abundance found; He gloried in his earth-wide right.  God made the earth and sky—the breath Of mountain and of smiling vale— And filled them all with life, not death, As bracing as the ocean gale!
Earth -- out of Earth God shaped and made All lovely things to signify His love:- The flowers arrayed On the shy amorous bosom of the Spring; All vegetable forms that move Up to the rain and sun for harvesting: Odors and colors, beasts and birds Are symbols, signs and words Of the unfathomable mystery of Earth; And out of Earth God made His spouse Nature-the fruitful bride of His terrene house, And her He filled with tears and mirth, With grace and strength, and scorn and hate, With hope and quietude, Patience and fortitude, Passion and dream, And Fate: Nature, the immaculate Mother, Nature the bride Of God's own [illegible], conceived and brought Forth of God's Spirit and Earth Man to his birth.  The body of Man! Infinite perfection of dust! Shadowy as desire On the crust Of a world In the blazing path of a million whirling suns; Strong to lift all heaven's weight of stars In the will of brain, and the fire Of passionate, pulsing blood; Swift as a lightning, hurled Down by the sickle of Time; Imperishable as bronze In the seed of parenthood; Beautiful and sublime In color and shape and line:— Divine, This infinite perfection of dust, The body of Man!  On this mysterious plan God build Him His temple of Man  Of indestructible dust; And He gave ye the trust As a sacred dower To keep it in beauty For ye are the priests and the keepers of this, The visible temple of God. From the time of man's birth to his sleep in the sod Ye must hold to the duty, The service and the sacrifice, Building, rebuilding, and building anew The structure of flesh, with the subtle device Of a skill the schools have taught you, Of a wisdom which Nature alone imparts. Ye bring no wares to the marts, Ye barter no loss or gain; Ye stand at the altar-steps of life For the sole redemption of pain. Time and the world's unintelligible strife Batter humanity Patient and serene, ye come to lives that grieve. Discern your dedicated duty Heal and retrieve.  Ye gatherers here,— Keepers with all the world's keepers Of God's temple of dustYe tarry the dream from the sleepers, And the death, life gives to your trust;-- And ye fare, With your infinite skill, the perfect skill that ye have When life battles with death, Ye fare and lead us Out of the hurts that bleed us, Not alone from the grave Of endless sleep: But by the power ye have When life struggles with death, Ye keep The pride and hope of a Race that toils the sleep.

Oh Goddess of song, come grant a reflection!   Unbolt the great doors of memory's wall,   And there let me enter, in gardens, through   court-yards;   And view the great paintings, that hang   in the hall.   Then grant at yourieisure, some musical  measure;   My harp is untuned and infer' or to thine:   So pledge me one measure, 'twill be of great  pleasure.   Perchance it might soothe this vain yearn ing of mine.     Then away let me ramble, 'cross brooklets through brambles,   'Cross moorland through fallows,     To the far distant hill ;   Where the century eagle 'mong the cliffs find her hiding,     And the night winds bring notes,   From the wild whip-poor-will.   She took up her harp, embossed with rare jewels;   The numberless strings all glittered like gold;   Then a bright glittering ra in-bow decended from heaven,   Surounded the damsel, illuming the whole.      Her jewel decked fingers were active and nimble   A bracelet of rubies hung loose from her wrist,   Her dark curly locks had gold in their tresses;   Her face was so comely, there was nothing amiss.   She scarce touched the strings.   Ere the great harp responded;     The music was soft yet it echoed afar:   And the sweet chimes came back from wood-land and mountain.   And through the great halUway, whose door stood ajar.    I entered the hall-way and gazed at the paintings.   Both modern and ancient, magnificent,  grand ;   My eyes caught the beauty,   Mine ears drank the music;   That came from her harp, and re-echoed the land.   And last, but not least, to the rear of the hall-way.   There hung a great painting of wonderfulcost;   And the muse on her harp played a dirge sweet and solemn.   As I gazed at my crucified Lord on the cross.    His visage though care worn,   Sliowed love and compassion;   Great nails pierced His hands,   And like wise, His feet:   Me thought I could hear the wail of the women   Decending the vale of Mt. Calvary's Steep.   Then the muse touched the strings,   And a great song of triumph,   Rang out in the hall-way,     Ere I thought to depart,   While mine eyes caught the sight of a wonderful painting;    That brought great rapture and joy to my heart.    'Twas where He had entered.    The geat gates of Heaven,   And countless the angels about Him did throng;    Here the muse ceased her playing,    For she teared to attempt it,   And she blushed when I asked her,   To join in the song.   As I left the great hall-way,   The door closed behind me;   The muse she had vanished,   The music had ceased;    I awoke 'twas a dream- the rain was fast falling,   And the wind shook my lattice.   That came from the east.    
GOD, Thou who doest all things well, Come in our hearts once more to dwell, Drive pain and woe and gloom away By thoughts which uppermost should stay. Submission sent by Thee divine Through all our walks and ways to shine, Now “Fill the ranks ’’ comes down the line, Send zeal and power, O God divine.  Thy will it was to take our best. . “My work is finished, let me rest " Our chieftain cried. The answer came In sleep as quiet and the same As that of chidhood. Only we Distressèd are. He lives with Thee.  By fall of great men let there rise Ardor and strength to make us wise In works acceptable to Thee, Till we thy glory, Lord, may see In all the land around us spread, Inall the paths that we now tread.  Thy power it is to rouse, awake, By great men's deaths, the thoughts that make Powers, latent, to the front arise. And living men, whose strength now lies At lowest ebb, may at thy call Arouse with will to render all, For noblest work, for highest aim, For that which teaches us the same Thyself has taught. “Who would be great His brother serves.” Initiate Some heart our leader's place to fill: And in us, highest be thy will.
In a cave deep in the forest, Where the pines and hemlocks whisper, Dwelt the crafty fox, Lute-si-ah, And his lovely little daughter. Years before the mother left him, Left him sad and broken-hearted ; With a farewell benediction, Left him clinging to his offspring. Just as Summer passed to Autumn, When the leaves were tinged with yellow ; When the ice in flowery crystals, Formed on all the pools and shallows, Came a sickness on the children, Bringing death and desolation. And Lute-si-ah's little daughter Paled and sickened with the others; Drooped her head and gently withered, Like a rosebud in the Autumn. Loud Lute-si-ah cried in anguish, Cried until through all the forest, Rang his bitter lamentation, Like the soughing of the pine trees. “Oh, my daughter | " cried he, wildly, “You have left me without warning, Left me old and broken-hearted : I will follow till I find you, I will cross the magic river ; I will seek the land of spirits, Till I find and recognize you.” Straightway then the fox departed On his strange and awful journey, Day and night he traveled onward, Ever eastward still he traveled, Till he came unto the heavens, To the regions of the spirits, To the magic river, Wun-ner. Blue its waters were and turbid, Swift and cruel swept its current, Singing, as it rolled and thundered, Notes of sadness and of warning. No one yet e'er crossed that river, Unless spirit forms had rowed them, Spirit forms must lead and guide them To the land of dreams and visions, To their home of bliss eternal. And the lark, the merry Whool-hool, In her bosom held the secret How to signal for the spirits, How to lure them and entice them From repose in realms celestial. Loud and long Lute-si-ah pleaded With the Whool-hool for her secret ; Told her of his age and weakness, Of his pain and bitter sorrow ; How his eyes were weak with weeping, How his heart was almost broken, Longing, seeking for his daughter. Vain was all Lute-si-ah's pleading, Fruitless was his inquisition, For the Whool-hool sang unheedi Sang derisively unceasing. Flamed Lute-si-ah's heart within him, Flamed with anger and with cunning, Smouldered like an unseen ember, Till the east wind blew and fanned it Silently he stalked the Whool-hool, With a spring he seized and crushed her, Broke her legs and left her lying Helpless, bleeding by the river. {{Now,” he cried, his anger cooling, “I will dictate while you listen You no longer can torment me, You no longer can refuse me. I will make you legs of alder, Make them better far and longer ; . Make them durable and firmer : You must first reveal your secret How to signal for the spirits, How to lure them and entice them From repose in realms celestial.” Then the Whool-hool told her secret, In exchange for legs of alder ; Told Lute-si-ah, in the marshes, He must find a wand of willow, Then lie down beside the river, Wave his wand and whisper softly For the spirits to receive him. When Lute-si-ah gave his signal, Lay down close beside the river, Waved his wand and whispered softly, Thought intently of his daughter; In a twinkling changed the landscape, Like a shifting panorama. There was neither sun nor moonlight, There was neither dawn nor twilight ; But a silvery sheen of splendor, From an unseen source shone on him. Calm and tranquil was the river, As a sheeted lake in winter; All the air was filled with music, Filled with music and with fragrance. While Lute-si-ah gazed enchanted At this wondrous transformation, From the shore across the river, Came a boat of gold, all burnished Like the setting sun in Autumn. Spirit forms manned oar and paddle, That were made of shining silver, Set with jewels rare and costly. Noiselessly the boat sped onward, Glided straight across the river Paused and waited for a moment, Like a spectre in the water. Without sound or salutation, To Lute-si-ah, spirits beckoned, Took him in the boat beside them, Rowed him back across the river To the land of dreams and visions, To the region of the spirits. There he found his little daughter, Found and recognized her spirit, Heard her voice and saw her image, Listened to her childish prattle. In the spirit world around him, There were Indians from all nations ; Spirits that had long departed, Came and talked to him in whispers ; Listened to his tale of sorrow, Comforted and reassured him, Sympathized, and thus consoled him. “We are happy,” said the spirits, “We are happy and contented, But for good of all the red men, That the tribes may live and prosper, Be a strong and vigorous nation, We will go back earthward with you : All the dead in all the ages, Will assemble there together, Till so numerous will our race be, That the earth will scarcely hold us.” On Lute-si-ah's back were fastened Magic parcels wrapped in deer skin; He was rowed across the river, And with careful admonition, There was given his instructions. “You will find,” the spirits told him, “When you reach the land of living, Five steep mountains and deep valleys, That will try your strength and courage. Keep your eye upon the summit, Pause not on your homeward journey, Look not at the parcels on you, Till the fifth hill you've ascended, Lest the magic spell be broken. Look not backward, look not sidewise ; Listen not to friend or stranger, Who may tempt you with their questions, With their vain and idle gossip.” Steep and rocky were the mountains, Long and tiresome were the valleys, That the fox found on his journey, As he plodded slowly homeward. Eagerly he crossed the first hill, Then the second and the third one ; Crossed the fourth, although his burden Sorely tempted and oppressed him. On the final hill, the fifth one, As Lute-si-ah labored upward, Tisch, the beetle, overtook him, Tisch, the lazy, idle dreamer, Always asking foolish questions. “Hold, my friend ” he droned out softly, “Rest awhile beneath the pine tree; Let us stop and talk together. Tell me of your strange adventures; What is in those hidden parcels, That you stagger like a drunk man 2'' Then Lute-si-ah, lame and weary, Weak and trembling 'neath his burden, That grew heavier each moment, Thought not of the spirits' warning, Heeded not their words of caution ; Sat down with the Tisch togossip, Opened up the magic parcels, Lest his friend be disappointed, • When they opened up the parcels, Sudden darkness fell upon them ; All the air was filled with music, Filled with music and with fragrance. Spirit voices whispered tothem, Whispered softly and in concert : “Keep your eye upon the summit, Look not backward ; look not sidewise, Listen not tofriend orstranger, Who may tempt you with their questions, With their vain and idle gossip.” Once again the sun shone brightly, Shone upon the hills and valleys; Shone upon the fox and beetle, Stricken dumb upon the hillside. Gone were all the magic parcels, Gone the music and the darkness ; Gone were all the Indian spirits To their home high in the heavens, In the realms of the celestial
All hail with joy the senior class, the  class of 1910,  For four long years we labored hard, - the Art Degrees to win,  But though the prize is in our grasp and we have won the race  Our  minds are filled with tender thoughts, as we leave this dear place.   The boys now think of old Clark Hall in which they often slept.  The girls look back on Miner Hall, where social hours were kept.  They both recall the chapel dear, for there God's words were taught.  And hear anew that splendid choir, whose music wonders wrought.   We next review old football games, with Union, Lincoln, Shaw,  How we did yell for our home tean, and fill the air with rahs, *  We saw them hit and plow the line, we saw them cross the goal,  And cheered them as they won each game, for they were brave and bold.   Ah, those were joyous, thrilling times, when might and skill did meet,  To see which team would honor win, and which would receive defeat.  Should we not praise our own dear team, since it surpassed thêm all  And plainly showed to all the world, that we could play football?   The great debates dart through our minds, here brains were put to test.  We met Atlanta, Lincohı, Fisk, who fought us with their best.  But better still were those they met, who fought for Howard's cause.  So each in turn received defeat, while we received applause.   Does this not prove beyond all doubt that Howard holds first place.  Among her sister colleges, which educate our race?  Does this not show she's moving on to greater, grander things,  That she will soon toward any school her fearful challenge fling?   Try as we may we can't forget the social times we had.  In company with our college friends who.made our poor hearts glad.  How tender are those memories now, since we from them must part.  And somewhere in this great wide world, our life anew to start.   Our minds now drift to class room. work, where knowledge did abound,  Alas, we see our store is small, as leaving day roll's round.  But learning is not useful now, if it is not applied,  So we will use our little bit in some field it's desired .  Some way, of course good teachers make, because they can instruct.  Some lawyers and physicians be, since they possess the pluck,  What course indeed the rest may take, I can't with ease foretell,  But this I hope, whate'er it is, that they may do it well.   For all of us in battle line must fight our way through life,  The conflict often will be fierge, uncertain oft the strife,  But we must stand' like ingot steel, without a groan or sigh,  And execute our class motto, To conquer or to die.   Our wandering minds return at last, the time draws near to leave,  We must express our parting thanks for benefits received,  Our parting words must then be said, to teachers, mates friends, and  Ere we depart from these dear walls, and college days shall end.   God bless our noble president, who by his earnest zeal,  Has roused our latest energies, and opened up new fields.  The Science Hall, the new Library, are products of his works,  And what we need now is a gym, let us this task not shirk.   All honor to our noble Deans, for they built up the school,  And dedicated life and thought to students as a rule.  We thank them more for what they, did to make our lives refined.  Than what they taught of calculus and other stuff combined.   Let praises ring for teachers now, for they our thoughts did mold.  And anything not clear to us they gladly did unfold,  Although their tests were difficult, and oft much thought required.  We managed to get by them all, and now we're satisfied.   The saddest thae of all has come, we bid class-mates farewell,  May all of us lead useful, lives, and ignorance dispel,  Good by, dear Alma Mater, you, we shall e'er defend,  Whate'er we do; where'er we be, the class of 1910.  
The Vision By William Stanley Braithwaite  (McClure's Magazine for June.)  You are the vision, you are the image of the dream, The voice among the stars, the silence in the stream; A breath of the infinite poise, where space and time are spun, And the circling orbits wheel their planets round the sun. Beyond the outer margin where nothing calls to God Leaps the fiery symbol to bloom wherever your feet have trod; Here is the earth resurgent with color and bloom of spring, Glorying the dream and the vision of the song you bring.  
Softly, quite softly— For I hear, above the murmur of the sea, Faint and far-fallen footsteps, as of One Who comes from out beyond the endless ends of Time, With voice that downwar d looms thro' singing stars; Its subtle sound I see thro' these long - darkened eyes, I hear the Light He bringeth on his hands— Almight  Death! Softly, oh, softly, lest he pass me by, And that unquivering Light toward which my longing soul And tortured body through these years have writhed, Fade to the dun darkness of my days.  Softly, full softly, let me rise and greet The strong, low luting of that long - awaited call; Swiftly be all my good and going gone, And this vast veiled and vanquished vigor of my soul Seek somehow otherwhere its rest and goal, Where endless spaces stretch, Where endless time doth moan, Where endless light doth pour Thro ' the black kingdoms of eternal death.  Then haply I may see what things I have not seen, Then I may know what things I have not known; Then may I do my dreams! Farewell! No sound of idle mourning let there be To shudder this full silence—save the voice Of children—little children, white and black, Whispering the deeds I tried to do for them; While I at last unguided and alone Pass—softly, full softly.  — W. E. B. D . in the N. Y. World . [The blind editor of the New York World died October 29, 1911, murmuring in German, "Leise, ganz leise!" His paper always treated  black folk fairly, in market contrast to most New York dailies.]
Float ever by me In countless numbers, Like waves in the mighty sea, Strange faces of alien gaze, Hurrying on to and from daily strife, This way, and now that, yet all, all Foreign, unfamiliar–still I stand and call  In hushed breath, and wait for one Who passeth by, never. Yet I fear to leave my lonely place– My watch-tower of delight where with me Dwell Hope and Patience; The one–sweet counseling voice– Make days grow short, and I rejoice When Patience laves my distressed soul With reason and points to the goal Where, though faint and dim, I shall stand face to face, And in love’s sweet embrace, Fine and know My Heart's Desire. 
I have wander’d late and early to the spot I love so dearly, Where the scent of honeysuckle mingles with the tender rose. There the incense sweet and holy sheathing me, I dreaming only While a subtle spell fast held me as the mist above me posted. A sweet fragrance as of clover all around me seem’d to hover. While a secret power charmed me and my senses idly roam’d. Then a magic something shower’d and a halo ‘round me flowered While I courted fancy notions of my little love Salome.  I have faced from climates warmer, white and dusky wily charmers, And I’ve watched their flirting eyelash and their actions blithe or shy But withal their fetching manner did not charm me nor enamor, I saw nothing in their graces that was pleasing to my eye. But the rose to me so sweetly cooing, loving so discreetly, Sends a summons of devotion ev’ry place that I may roam. For she is a gem completely, clad in robes precise and neatly. And the bond of love is lasting between me and sweet Salome.  
O mist-blown Lily of the north, A-bnding southward in thy bloom, And bringing beauty silver sown And pale blue radiance of snows--  O fair white lily, bowin low, Above the dream-swept poppy's mouth, Athwart the black and crimson South-- Why dost thou fear--why dos thou fear?   Lo! sense its sleep-sown subtle breath, Where wheel in passioned whirl above All lingering, luring love of love-- All perfume born of dole and deaht.  Cold ghost-wreathed Lily of the North, When once thy dawning darkens there, Come then with sunlight-sifted hair And seek the haunting heaven of Night.  Where, over moon-mad shadows whirled, The star-tanned mists dim swathe the sky In phantasy to dream and die-- A wild sweetg wedding of the World.  
When April's here and meadows wide  Once more with spring's sweet growths are pied      I close each book, drop each pursuit,      And past the brook, no longer mute,  I joyous roam the countryside.  Look, here the violets shy abide  And there the mating robins hide—     How keen my sense, how acute,        When April's here!  And list! down where the shimmering tide  Hard by that farthest hill doth glide,      Rise faint strains from shepherd's flute,      Pan's pipes and Berecyntian lute.  Each sight, each sound fresh joys provide        When April's here.  
A certain element in the South takes pains to rear the children of the family faithfully in the doctrines of Blease and Vardaman. 'A Negro had been lynched in the neighborhood,' said a recently returned traveler, 'and crowds went out to see what was left of his body. The people I was staying with went with the rest and took their children--all but one, who had been naughty and was kept home as a punishment.'  I met a little blue-eyed girl-- She said she was five years old; 'Your locket is very pretty dear; And pray what may it hold?' And then--my heart grew chill and sick-- The gay child did not flinch-- 'I found it--the tooth of a colored man-- My father helped to lynch.' 'And what had he done, my fair-haired child?' (Life and Death play a fearful game!) 'Oh, he did nothing--they made a mistake-- But they had their fun, just the same!' 
Here in the time of the Winter morn,     Love. I see the Sunlit leaves of changing hue Burn clear against a sky of tender blue, Here in the time of Winter morn,     Love. I hear the low tone bells of changing song Ring clear upon the air the full day long, Here in the time of Winter morn,     Love. I hear the bells, I see the changing leaves, And one lone heart for Summer silent grieves, Here in the time of Winter morn,     Love.  
To be a Negro in a day like this   Demands forgiveness. Bruised with blow on blow, Betrayed, like him whose woe dimmed eyes gave bliss   Still must one succor those who brought one low, To be a Negro in a day like this.  To be a Negro in a day like this   Demands rare patience--patience that can wait In utter darkness. 'Tis the path to miss,   And knock, unheeded, at an iron gate, To be a Negro in a day like this.  To be a Negro in a day like this   Demands strange loyalty. We serve a flag Which is to us white freedom's emphasis.   Ah! one must love when Truth and Justice lag, To be a Negro in a day like this.  To be a Negro in a day like this--   Alas! Lord God, what evil have we done? Still shines the gate, all gold and amethyst,   But I pass by, the glorious goal unwon, "Merely a Negro"--in a day like this! 
O brothers mine, to-day we stand       Where half a century sweeps our ken,     Since God, through Lincoln's ready hand,       Struck off our bonds and made us men.     Just fifty years--a winter's day--       As runs the history of a race;     Yet, as we look back o'er the way,       How distant seems our starting place!     Look farther back! Three centuries!       To where a naked, shivering score,     Snatched from their haunts across the seas,       Stood, wild-eyed, on Virginia's shore.     Far, far the way that we have trod,       From heathen kraals and jungle dens,     To freedmen, freemen, sons of God,       Americans and Citizens.     A part of His unknown design,       We've lived within a mighty age;     And we have helped to write a line       On history's most wondrous page.     A few black bondmen strewn along       The borders of our eastern coast,     Now grown a race, ten million strong,       An upward, onward marching host.     Then let us here erect a stone,       To mark the place, to mark the time;     A witness to God's mercies shown,       A pledge to hold this day sublime.     And let that stone an altar be,       Whereon thanksgivings we may lay,     Where we, in deep humility,       For faith and strength renewed may pray.     With open hearts ask from above       New zeal, new courage and new pow'rs,     That we may grow more worthy of       This country and this land of ours.     For never let the thought arise       That we are here on sufferance bare;     Outcasts, asylumed 'neath these skies,       And aliens without part or share.     This land is ours by right of birth,       This land is ours by right of toil;     We helped to turn its virgin earth,       Our sweat is in its fruitful soil.     Where once the tangled forest stood,--       Where flourished once rank weed and thorn,--     Behold the path-traced, peaceful wood,       The cotton white, the yellow corn.     To gain these fruits that have been earned,       To hold these fields that have been won,     Our arms have strained, our backs have burned,       Bent bare beneath a ruthless sun.     That Banner which is now the type       Of victory on field and flood--     Remember, its first crimson stripe       Was dyed by Attucks' willing blood.     And never yet has come the cry--       When that fair flag has been assailed--     For men to do, for men to die,       That have we faltered or have failed.     We've helped to bear it, rent and torn,       Through many a hot-breath'd battle breeze;     Held in our hands, it has been borne       And planted far across the seas.     And never yet--O haughty Land,       Let us, at least, for this be praised--     Has one black, treason-guided hand       Ever against that flag been raised.     Then should we speak but servile words,       Or shall we hang our heads in shame?     Stand back of new-come foreign hordes,       And fear our heritage to claim?     No! stand erect and without fear,       And for our foes let this suffice--     We've bought a rightful sonship here,       And we have more than paid the price.     And yet, my brothers, well I know       The tethered feet, the pinioned wings,     The spirit bowed beneath the blow,       The heart grown faint from wounds and stings;     The staggering force of brutish might,       That strikes and leaves us stunned and dazed;     The long, vain waiting through the night       To hear some voice for justice raised.     Full well I know the hour when hope       Sinks dead, and 'round us everywhere     Hangs stifling darkness, and we grope       With hands uplifted in despair.     Courage! Look out, beyond, and see       The far horizon's beckoning span!     Faith in your God-known destiny!       We are a part of some great plan.     Because the tongues of Garrison       And Phillips now are cold in death,     Think you their work can be undone?       Or quenched the fires lit by their breath?     Think you that John Brown's spirit stops?       That Lovejoy was but idly slain?     Or do you think those precious drops       From Lincoln's heart were shed in vain?     That for which millions prayed and sighed,       That for which tens of thousands fought,     For which so many freely died,       God cannot let it come to naught.
That one might live in the sunlight glad    And know the day; That one might dream in the shadows     And love alway. To love and to live and to know, To feel the sea's strength and sea's flow, That one might sleep while the heart is mad    And sorrow play! that one might speak when the soul's athirst    And hear the cry; That one might feel when the heart has burst   And love the why. O to speak and to feel and to know, O to love the wind's strength and wind's blow, That one might walk with the sorrows first,    Nor weep, nor sigh! O to know and to love and to live, O to speak and hear and to give,    Nor fear to die!

Like death-loosed poets, with their breeze-blown hair, Hymning to mountains, precipice and palm, Or sighing soft as Seraph's evening psalm— Startled by storm burst; stilled in love's deep loss, Listen, O Dream Isles of the Orient Main, Thy brown elves wake and pour lost Eden's choral strain!   II. Thrilled by brown magi from the nymphean coves. Old nations sing as if the centuries Sighed to the stars some old, lost planet's love; Now Egypt breathes: now Babylon, Persia, Greece, Through these soft pipes, wake, sighing, like the groves Where gods have wandered, and where winds are whispering "Peace." But hear the flute's sweet eccentricities 'Neath the white moon, you castled stream above, Till crash of cymbals, turban'd Turks have known, And sound's fine rain, and booming of deep drums, (And the brown gnome who pursueth wind gusts through Old Triton's wreathed shell, he wakes anew— Bellowing, like Neptune's rage, with much ado), Drown, with their ocean roar, the little bird Whose notes, like dainty Ariel's, laughed that they were heard. Was it Adonis, wandering alone, Waked, with sweet lips, the silver piccolo, Fair Music's nightingale, which sang: "Mine own, Mine own, dear Love, dost thou not know; not know?" Now, o'er the hills, is it Apollo comes, Pouring (oh, hear!) sound's golden honey down could drown Those silver reeds whose notes go down to some Well's bottom, over crystal rocks?Oh, come! Hear music ripple, like a breeze that's blown O'er ripening fields and Daphne's rosy vale, Full, deep and resonant! Hear this rose gale Of June's sweet Calliope wake, and all The muses rouse from dreamy murmurings! Hear shout and revel; romp and tipsy call Of woodland fairies. List! What siren sings O'er ocean voicings— deep, divinely deep! What billowed tempests rage; what surge and sweep; What equal thunderings storm Poseidon's throne, And sound Earth's black abyss! Now Ares fires The clouds, and far his awful symphony fills The world. 'Tis war! Embattled Harmony Sends Echo flying, golden, to the hills, To win brave heights where the winged eagle tires. And oh! the battle music rageth gloriously! Till, victory won, a last loud bar begins With roll of kettledrums, like boom of bees that drone, On heavy wings, down sultry summer winds, And unmolested bays where love sees one white sail.   III.  And what of him who leads these happy fauns? This Afric' Pan who broke the crystal lip Of Sound's lost river; plashed there, and let drip Thy soul, O Islands, mystical and sweet, Through reeds that bowed and nodded at Taft's feet, Fair and unbroken, 'mid the clamorous Dawn's Cry and appealings? Courage, O my race!  Courage and patience, Islands; ye shall yet have place!   * Written at the suggestion of Dr. W. Bishop Johnson, of Washington, D. C.  
Oh sweet, as an orient 'Maid o' the moon,'    With wild roses in her dark hair, Entranced by the magical minstrel June,    May stands in her garden fair.  For June, the herald of summer gay,    Is prince of its minstrelsy; And never a monarch of ancient day    Wore gaudier robes than he. Over the hills comes the minstrel June,    Perfuming and thrilling the air; Sweet may will sink on his breast a-swoon,     And die as he holds her there.  
Dusky lashes droop and fall, Night-winds whisper, night-birds call. Close your tired sleepy eyes, Earth is singing lullabies, Kindly twilight shadows creep O’er a world that longs for sleep, Little dusky babe of mine Close those sleepy eyes of thine, Mother’s love will softly keep  Watch above you while you sleep, Cruel hate and deadly wrong Cannot silence mother’s song Though against thy soft brown cheek She may hide her face and weep. Sleep, brown baby, while you may Peacefully, at close of day. Oh, that mother’s love could guard, Keep thee safe ‘neath watch and ward From the cruelly deadly things  That await thee while she sings. Prejudice and cold white hate: These, my baby, these, thy fate, Little, gentle, trustful thing,  Thus, these sobs, the while I sing.  
Thou quiv’ring tongue of fire!     Bring to our land a Pentecost, The hearts of men inspire To gain once more the freedom they have lost. And fire with pristine courage sire and son, Burn on.  Thou flaring sheet of flame! Burn like a startling come of high, Forewarning in God’s name And writing truth on our deceptive sky Whose quiet aspect has another mien  Unseen. Thou whetted sword of truth! Thou brandished sword make tyrants shake, But stalwart men and youth From the oppressed are rising up to break The bonds of bondage and the bars of caste. At last. Thou freedoms clarion call! Wake the oppressed, ring in their ears, Call them to rally all As one, unite their strength, shake off their fears, And fight till freedom’s battles are won–  Call on! Thou mighty “still, small voice!” Speak on till thou art clearly heard! Let the oppressed rejoice And the oppressor tremble at thy word, Until the truth is known and justice is done Speak on! 
With brawny arms the negro stands, Uplifting in his sable hands  King Cotton; while about him grow The pretty buds as white as snow. His arms alone support, sustain, His royal person while he reigns, Exalt, ye nations that be prone, Him who thus stands beneath the throne For lo, what danger! what alarm! Should he withdraw his mighty arm. Pray, what if he should take away That pow’r which gives King Cotton sway O’er all the world; for by his right  He can withhold that which would be blight The nations all upon the globe. For though he may not wear the robe, Nor on the regal throne may sit, He is the king; though black quite fit; Despite illit’racy and birth, To wield the scepter o’er the earth. 
(Inspired by the Washington protest meeting)  Strong spirits must awaken! for the time, Unhealthy with a bitter sick unrest That ne'er relaxes in our fevered breast, Bids that we, Godlike, rise above the crime That sullies the still beauty of our time, That makes a noble state seem still unblest, Because her weaker brothers find no rest, But wearied, labor in a cause sublime. Come forth! ye deep-voices star-souled men, And o'er the sounding land raise high your song, Sing o'er and o'er the truth you love again, To tame the terror of this fearful wrong, Teach deep inwrought the power of love through all, That without which earth's glories all must fall.  
He had a whim, and laughted it out    Upon the exit of a chance; He floundered in a sea of doubt--    If life was real--or just romance.  Sometimes upon his brow would come    A little pucker of defiance; He totalled in a word the sum    If life was real--or just romance.  And then a hearty laugh would break,    A reasoning shrug of shoulder; And we would from his fancy take    A faith in death which made life bolder. 
I kissed a kiss in youth    Upon a dead man's brow; And that was long ago,--    And I'm a grown man now.  It's lain there in the dust,    Thirty years and more;-- My lips that set a light    At a dead man's door.  
I thought how ofte the great gray god of years, Swinging adown the dark abysm of time, Some lamp portentous in the dimness rears, Some taper high, ineffable, sublime: Now darts a gleam faint thrilling through the deep, And now a glimmer from archangels' wings; And then once more the mighty aeons sleep, Lost in the slumber that the darkness brings; And then I creamed of one Promethean light, That, throbbing, as a mystic searchlight blazed Through all the caverns. Nature leaped in might To greet the signal from the rampart raised; Her innocent heart at last a flame inquired; And one by one all other lights expired.  
Spring, thou wilful, changeful maid, Venturesome, yet half afraid    King Winter to defy! Come, with all thy airs and graces, Perfumes sweet and flower-laces; When thy beauty rare he faces,     He of love will die.  
One does such work as one will not,   And well each knows the right; Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,   The black must serve the white. And it's, oh, for the white man's softening flesh,   While the black man's muscles grow! Well I know which grows the mightier,   I know; full well I know. The white man seeks the soft, fat place,   And he moves and he works by rule. Ingenious grows the humbler race   In Oppression's prodding school. And it's, oh, for a white man gone to seed,   While the Negro struggles so! And I know which race develops most,   I know; yes, well I know. The white man rides in a palace car,   And the Negro rides "Jim Crow." To damn the other with bolt and bar,   One creepeth so low; so low! And it's, oh, for a master's nose in the mire,   While the humbled hearts o'erflow! Well I know whose soul grows big at this,   And whose grows small; I know! The white man leases out his land,   And the Negro tills the same. One works; one loafs and takes command;   But I know who wins the game! And it's, oh, for the white man's shrinking soil,   As the black's rich acres grow! Well I know how the signs point out at last,   I know; ah, well I know! The white man votes for his color's sake,   While the black, for his is barred; (Though "ignorance" is the charge they make),   But the black man studies hard. And it's, oh, for the white man's sad neglect,   For the power of his light let go! So, I know which man must win at last,   I know! Ah, Friend, I know!
Still are there wonders of the dark and day:    The muted shrilling of shy things at night,       So small beneath the stars and moon;    The peace, dream-frail, but perfect while the light       Lies softly on the leaves at noon.          These are, and these will be              Until eternity; But she who loved them well has gone away.  Each dawn, while yet the east is veiléd grey,    The birds about her window wake and sing;       And far away, each day, some lark    I know is singing where the grasses swing;       Some robin calls and calls at dark.          These are, and these will be              Until eternity; But she who loved them well has gone away.  The wild flowers that she loved down green ways stray;    Her roses lift their wistful buds at dawn,       But not for eyes that loved them best;    Only her little pansies are all gone,       Some lying softly on her breast.          And flowers will bud and be              Until eternity; But she who loved them well has gone away.  Where has she gone? And who is there to say?    But this we know: her gentle spirit moves       And is where beauty never wanes,    Perchance by other streams, mid other groves;       And to us there, ah! she remains          A lovely memory              Until eternity; She came, she loved, and then she went away. 
Take up the Black Man’s burden— Send forth the worst ye breed, And bind our sons in shackles To serve your selfish greed.  To wait in heavy harness, Be-deviled and beguiled Until the Fates Remove you From a world you have defiled.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— Your lies may still abide To veil the threat of terror, And check our racial pride;  Your cannon, church and courthouse May still our sons constrain To seek the white man’s profit And work the white man’s gain.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— Reach out and hog the earth, And leave your workers hungry In the country of their birth.  Then, when your goal is nearest, The end for which you fought, Watch Teuton trained efficiency Bring all your hope for nought.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— Reduce their chiefs and kings To toil of serf and sweeper, The lot of common things.  Sodden their soil with slaughter Ravish their lands with lead; Go, sign them with your living And seal them with your dead.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— And keep your old reward; The curse of those ye cozen, The hate of those ye barred  From your Canadian cities And your Australian ports; And when they ask for meat and drink, Go, girdle them with forts.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— Ye cannot stoop to less. Will not your fraud of freedom Still cloak your greediness?  But, by the gods ye worship, And by the deeds ye do, These silent, sullen peoples Shall weigh your gods and you.  Take up the Black Man’s burden— Until the tale is told, Until the balances of hate Bear down the beam of gold.  And while ye wait, remember That Justice, though delayed, Will hold you as her debtor, till The Black Man’s debt is paid.
O BROTHERS mine, take care! Take care!     The great white witch rides out to-night.     Trust not your prowess nor your strength,     Your only safety lies in flight;     For in her glance there is a snare,             And in her smile there is a blight.       The great white witch you have not seen?     Then, younger brothers mine, forsooth,     Like nursery children you have looked     For ancient hag and snaggle-tooth;             But no, not so; the witch appears     In all the glowing charms of youth.       Her lips are like carnations, red,     Her face like new-born lilies, fair,     Her eyes like ocean waters, blue,             She moves with subtle grace and air,     And all about her head there floats     The golden glory of her hair.       But though she always thus appears     In form of youth and mood of mirth,             Unnumbered centuries are hers,     The infant planets saw her birth;     The child of throbbing Life is she,     Twin sister to the greedy earth.       And back behind those smiling lips,             And down within those laughing eyes,     And underneath the soft caress     Of hand and voice and purring sighs,     The shadow of the panther lurks,     The spirit of the vampire lies.               For I have seen the great white witch,     And she has led me to her lair,     And I have kissed her red, red lips     And cruel face so white and fair;     Around me she has twined her arms,             And bound me with her yellow hair.       I felt those red lips burn and sear     My body like a living coal;     Obeyed the power of those eyes     As the needle trembles to the pole;             And did not care although I felt     The strength go ebbing from my soul.       Oh! she has seen your strong young limbs,     And heard your laughter loud and gay,     And in your voices she has caught             The echo of a far-off day,     When man was closer to the earth;     And she has marked you for her prey.       She feels the old Antaean strength     In you, the great dynamic beat             Of primal passions, and she sees     In you the last besieged retreat     Of love relentless, lusty, fierce,     Love pain-ecstatic, cruel-sweet.       O, brothers mine, take care! Take care!             The great white witch rides out to-night.     O, younger brothers mine, beware!     Look not upon her beauty bright;     For in her glance there is a snare,     And in her smile there is a blight. 
A great swart cheek and the gleam of tears, The flutter of hopes and the shadow of fears, And all day long the rub and scrub With only a breath betwixt tub and tub. Fool! Thou hast toiled for fifty years And what hast thou now but thy dusty tears? In silence she rubbed . . . But her face I had seen, Where the light of her soul fell shining and clean. 
Outside I hear the dashing rain Fall full against the window pane.  On such a day, the fire aglow, An easy chair, a book or so,– What more would I that fortune bring? Yet hark! I hear a step–a ring– And close to heart and hearth I fold  My friend, who guessed my wish untold. For other joys I do not pray, Content am I this rainy day.   
In the fight at Brandywine, Black Samson, a giant negro armed with a scythe, sweeps his way thro' the red ranks" --C. M. Skinner's "Myths and Legends of Our Own Land.  Gray are the pages of record, Dim are the volumes of eld; Else had old Delaware told us More that her history held. Told us with pride in the story, Honest and noble and fine, More of the tale of my hero, Black Samson of Brandywine.  Sing of your chiefs and your nobles, Saxon and Celt and Gaul, Breath of mine ever shall join you, Highly I honor them all. Give to them all of their glory, But for this noble of mine, Lend him a tithe of your tribute, Black Samson of Brandywine.  There in the heat of the battle, There in the stir of the fight, Loomed he, an ebony giant, Black as the pinions of night. Swinging his scythe like a mower Over a field of grain, Needless the care of the gleaners, Where he had passed amain.  Straight through the human harvest, Cutting a bloody swath, Woe to you, soldier of Briton! Death is abroad in his path. Flee from the scythe of the reaper, Flee while the moment is thine, None may with safety withstand him, Black Samson of Brandywine.  Was he a freeman or bondman? Was he a man or a thing? What does it matter? His brav'ry Renders him royal -- a king. If he was only a chattel, Honor the ransom may pay Of the royal, the loyal black giant Who fought for his country that day.  Noble and bright is the story, Worthy the touch of the lyre, Sculptor or poet should find it Full of the stuff to inspire. Beat it in brass and in copper, Tell it in storied line, So that the world may remember Black Samson of Brandywine. 
The dreams of the dreamer Are life-drops that pass The break in the heart Thru the soul’s hour-glass. The songs of the singer  Are tones that repeat  The cry of the heart– ‘Till it ceases to beat.
Thru the land of tribulation,    O'er the river of despair, When the taut heart snaps with tension,    Fame awaits you, smiling there, After love has all been wasted,    After every song is sung; Late--too late, the world will crown you,    Useless! Love and song are done. 
The peerless boon of innocence,    The first in nature's list Has faded--ere the rising sun    The waking world has kist. The early dew upon the grass,    The purity of morn, The glint that lies on virgin-cheek    Are cob-webs of the dawn.  
I rest me deep within the wood,    Drawn by its silent call, Far from the throbbing crowd of men    On nature's breast I fall.    My couch is sweet with blossoms fair,    A bed of fragrant dreams, And soft upon my ear there falls    The lullaby of streams.    The tumult of my heart is stilled,    Within this sheltered spot. Deep in the bosom of the wood.    Forgetting, and — forgot! 
Oh! the summer is soft and the breezes blow Where my ship rides over the sea, And the gulls still eagerly lead I know, For my Love is Calling to me. Oh! the mist envelops my wine-spent years, And the ship of my hope goes down; But my soul sails on thru the sea of tears Where my Love’s sad Callings sound.   
See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye! No light is there; none, save the glint that shines In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs Of some wild animal caught in the hunter's trap.  How came this beast in human shape and form? Speak, man! - We call you man because you wear His shape-How are you thus? Are you not from That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race Which we have known three centuries? Not from That more than faithful race which through three wars Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!     I am, and am not.       Then who, why are you?    I am a thing not new, I am as old  As human nature. I am that which lurks, Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed; The ancient trait which fights incessantly Against restraint, balks at the upward climb; The weight forever seeking to obey The law of downward pull; and I am more: The bitter fruit am I of planted seed; The resultant, the inevitable end Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.    Lessons in degradation, taught and learned, The memories of cruel sights and deeds, The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate Filtered through fifteen generations have Sprung up and found in me sporadic life. In me the muttered curse of dying men, On me the stain of conquered women, and Consuming me the fearful fires of lust, Lit long ago, by other hands than mine. In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers Of wretches now long dead,--their dire bequests,-- In me the echo of the stifled cry Of children for their bartered mothers' breasts.  I claim no race, no race claims me; I am No more than human dregs; degenerate; The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin; I am-just what I am . . . . The race that fed Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same To-day, but I - Enough, the brute must die! Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist The fire much longer than this slender pine. Now bring the fuel! Pile it 'round him! Wait! Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose The agony and terror in his face. And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek! And there's another! Wilder than the first. Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so! Now let it slowly blaze again. See there! He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out, Searching around in vain appeal for help! Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts Down through the coils of chain that hold erect The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.  Stop! to each man no more than one man's share. You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain - Let us divide its links; this skull, of course, In fair division, to the leader comes.  And now his fiendish crime has been avenged; Let us back to our wives and children. - Say, What did he mean by those last muttered words, 'Brothers in spirit, brothers in deed are we'? 
Ah, whether I loved you, who can say? What of the chaff that lies i’ the way Of the wind blown off of the desert grey? (But I love you now–how well!) You choose me for love and I went with you  Yielding as reeds that the stream runs through– What was a broken heart to you? (But you taught me to love you well!)  Un-eager I was for your first long kiss–  Unstirred was my blood to your touch that is Today of fire, for Beloved, this Is verily love’s own spell.  My body and soul are yours to mend Or break or yet to with your own to blend. Ah, Master, keep me until the end– I have learned to love too well! 
I.  Lo, my Heart, behold! a girl of modest brown Is gliding down the paths of our town! Clings not round her the aura of the morning-child; For mark, Heart, she came not while Aurora smiled In silver effusion on the lucid air; Her figure is not dawn-pale, nor is her hair Fine-spun of sun-gold into a Phoebean crown! O Eyes, she is some quickened bronze, Which transformed to skin of finest texture, Unto the sense as exquisitely responds As any gloss of silk or softness of a plush! But nay, frail Eyes; trust not the groping, blind conjecture! Ah! tell my Heart by what mutations Could bronze be turned half so ravishingly lush, So ripened into rich refreshing fruit as is this girl? And furthermore, I ask you, Eyes, e'en tho' it were toothed Of ivory or milky-clouded pearl, As preciously cut and delicately smoothed As are her teeth, what mold of bronze—bronze cumbrous and cold— Could make upon my soul, oh! such enthralling seizure  As do these luxuriant beauties which some would dare hold Were but a darkling blush of shame?  II. Ah, no, Heart, 'twas of lowly, peaceful dusk God wrought her, And of benignities that the lofty spheres brought her; She is of Vesper, child and anointed daughter! Look! how all the charms of twilight gather to her frame, And the shades of tropics haunt her lissome shape! Ay, too, lambent stars are twinkling, e'en when noon's aflame; Here her crinkling, night-like tresses the gloaming drape. Soul, gaze her quiet eyes! From what divine skies Did they, with placid allure of dusk, escape— These amber haze-beams that, as if ordained, transfigure,  And with soft halos flush her every lovely feature? Bewitched Soul, how they mark her perfect, dusk-born creature!  III. Thus veined with angel-gossamers floated down By the eventide, she is become a blessed vision— Verily, O Soul! Soul! a miracle of brown! As closer now she comes, oh! mark each luster Which ripples in a sheen o'er the swarthness that is swirled About her from pale finger-nail to eye-lash thick-curled!  Soul, infinitely happy harmonies are Thus bodied by her in tender, gleamy dark!  IV. Ay, she carries the dim spirit of the vesper-star; And thence it comes that her sympathies impart To shadow-purpled nightingales the dreaming of her heart Which so elatedly he sings to rapt-hark'ning lark! So breathe, Heart, breathe the fragrances that cluster Round that sweet, peerless bower of her flesh whence she wafts The warm, reposeful shade of the holy palm And such meady dews as flavor lands of southern calm! And drink, Heart! O Heart! drink of Elysian balm Which her elixir-like touch brings in redolent drafts From nightward nectaries that have their place In lunar regions of supernal space! And then, my Heart, let your every vibrant fiber sense The essence, as it were, of oenomel which seems thence To lave its haze on her delicious face, Where is set, like a red-brown kiss, the mouth that quaffs Its flow—oh! blissful flow the nectaries dispense To but her who, by divine right of race,  Is twilight vestal, and to eve enchantress-daughter And purest cast of gloam in fluent grace of water!  V. God! shall lewd flames count wanton, wind-raked husk This girl whose nature heaves such sacred spells of dusk? Love! O true Love! how chaste with cloistral sundown And ways that breathe rosy airs of saintly musk,  Oh! she must be, since that her being wears for gown Heav'n's own highness in pure glows of auburn brown!  VI. Thus she moves zephyr-like in virgin grace of leisure! And since she is sylphine-imbued with nightfall 'that drowns Earth in ethereal tides of marvelous browns, How meet it is that her feet, O Columbian World, Are given to thread your occidental spread! Why then, mad World, are persecutive shadows thus hurled Before her feet? E'en so, World, behold! tho' meek and demure, Yet she walks in stanch and serene procedure, Unfaltering in her fortitude and gentle state, Towards far horizons where, beaconing, there wait For her more golden triumphs than any sunset has! Ay, her way leads through dread labyrinths of hate,  Mid trails of scorn pythonic, and minotaurs of wrath, But like the dusk, she walks above her earthly path!  VII. She is some ministrant dove of celestial orders, Or dark-veiled, mist-winged sprite, flown from Hesperian borders  And traced of poised cloud-drift and willowed, phantom waters! Up, Heart, and hail her, dusk-ennobled Queen of Daughters! 
I build my nest not on the crest Of the mountain-throne, but in the breast– The sheltering arm of the forest warm, Where my dovelets swing ‘mid the maddest storm; Here I see and sigh! ‘neath the grieving sky,  Lo, a race is hung on the trees! A-wing I go, and the land below  Is riot-red with a cruel woe; For the hand of Hate, at a furious rate, Is sowing the seeds of a terrible fate; And each venomous seed is the prejudice weed That buds and blooms with a murderous deed! Oh, I love the land of Justice grand,  Where men are free, heart, head and hand; Where the smile and nod of the greening sod Are bright and and glad with the gift of God: Where over the plains and the mountainous reigns The flag that frees each soul from chains! “Land of the free,” whose flag I see! What boots thy boast of Liberty?   What avails thy might, while in thy sight A race is robbed of its dearest right? Hark! I hear the yell of the hounds of hell– Thy sons obsessed with the lynching spell! How I long to see thy Liberty With e’en thy lowliest subject free; With none denied or crushed in pride, But souls ascending side by side; Thy streaming Stars and bleeding Bars Thus mean a victory more than war’s! “Let freedom ring”- ‘tis a well to sing,  But let it from the mountains bring– Not only to the fortunate few– Its peace to all ‘neath the “Red, White and Blue!” Ah! I see and sigh, ‘neath the heavens high, While a race is hung on the trees to die! 
We call him great for whom men strong and sure, Charged with the leaping lightning of his will, Crush mountains, shatter worlds and mold them o'er, But he who rules himself is greater still.  
From this low lying valley; Oh, how sweet And cool and calm and great is life, I ween, There on yon mountain-throne–that sun-gold crest! From this uplifted, mighty mountain-seat: How bright and still and warm and soft and green Seems yon low lilly-valve of peace and rest! 
She held him in her bronzen arms    And fed him from her lavish breast, And rid him of a child's alarms,    With songs that gave him rest.  He loved her tenderly, he said,    And vowed to fill her life with pleasure. He's growing old and she is dead,    A picture in his memory's treasure.  But once he paused upon the bench    Ere yet he spake the final sentence Upon a slender black-faced wench,    Whose eyes were grime with unrepentance:  "Old Mammy's child! Tut! Tut! 'Tis bad    For one so young to mock the law. Your mother's eyes must deepen sad,    She looked upon these things with awe."  
The Dawn’s awake!     A flash of smoldering flame and fire Ignites the East. Then, higher, higher,     O’er all the sky so gray, forlorn,  The torch of gold is borne.   The Dawn’s awake!    The dawn of a thousand dreams and thrills.  And music singing in the hills     A paean of eternal spring  Voices the new awakening.   The Dawn’s awake!       Whispers of pent-up harmonies,  With the mingled fragrance of the trees;       Faint snaches of half-forgotten song— Fathers! Torn and numb,—    The boon of light we craved, awaited long,  Has come, has come!  
Again it is September!  It seems so strange that I who made no vows Should sit here desolate this golden weather  And wistfully remember—      A sigh of deepest yearning,  A glowing look and words that knew no bounds,  A swift response, an instant glad surrender To kisses wild and burning!      Ay me!     Again it is September!  It seems so strange that I who kept those vows  Should sit here lone, and spent, and mutely praying  That I may not remember! 
And she shall be the friend of youth for aye; Of quick'ning youth whose eyes have seen the gleam; Of youth between whose tears and laughter stream Bright bows of hope; of youth, audacious, gay Who dares to know himself a Caesar, say, A Shakespeare or a Galahad. The dream To him is real: and things are as they seem, For Beauty veils from him the feet of clay.  How holy and how wonderful her trust-- Youth's friend--and yes, how blest. For down the west Each day shall go to the sun, and time in time Shall die, the unborn shall again be dust; But she with youth eternal on her breast, Immortal, too, shall sit serene, sublime.  
And they shall rise and cast their mantles by, Erect and strong and visioned, in the day That rings the knell of Curfew o'er the sway Of prejudice — who reels with mortal cry To lift no more her leprous, blinded eye. Reft of the fetters, far more cursed than they Which held dominion o'er human clay. The spirit soars aloft where rainbows lie.  Like joyful exiles swift returning home — The rhythmic chanson of their eager feet. While voices strange to ecstasy, long dumb. Break forth in major rhapsodies, full sweet. Into the very star-shine, lo! they come Wearing the bays of victory complete!  
I hear you singing happily, My boy of tarnished mien, Lifting your limpid, trustful gaze In innocence serene. A thousand javelins of pain Assault my heaving breast When I behold the storm of years That beat without your nest. O sing, my lark, your matin song Of joyous rhapsody, Distil the sweetness of the hours In gladsome ecstasy. For time awaits your buoyant flight Across the bar of years. Sing, sing your song, my bonny lark, Before it melts in tears!
The mother soothes her mantled child With incantation sad and wild; A deep compassion brims her eye And stills upon her lips, the sigh.  Her thoughts are leaping down the years, O’er branding bars, through seething tears, Her heart is sandaling his feet Adown the world’s corroding street.  Then, with a start she dons a smile His tender yearnings to beguile. And only God will ever know The wordless measure of her woe. 
There are tears sweet, refreshing like dewdrops that rise, There are tears far too deep for the lakes of the eyes.    There are kisses like thistledown, fitfully sped, There are kisses that live in the hearts of the dead.
Let me not lose my dream, e’en though I scan the veil with eyes unseeing through their glaze of tears, Let me not falter, though the rungs of fortune perish as I fare above the tumult, praying purer air, Let me not lose the vision, gird me. Powers that toss the worlds, I pray! Hold me, and guard, lest anguish tear my dreams away! 
Frail children of sorrow, dethroned by a hue, The shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through, The world has its motion, all things pass away. No night is omnipotent, there must be day. The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed, But swift is the season of nettle and weed. Abide yet awhile in the mellowing shade. And rise with the hour for which you were made. The cycle of seasons, the tidals of man Revolve in the orb of an infinite plan. We move to the rhythm of ages long done, And each has his hour — to dwell in the sun! 
How would you have us, as we are? Or sinking 'neath the load we bear? Our eyes fixed forward on a star? Or gazing empty at despair?  Rising or falling? Men or things? With dragging pace or footsteps fleet? Strong, willing sinews in your wings? Or tightening chains about your feet?
Applauding youths laughed with young prostitutes And watched her perfect, half-clothed body sway; Her voice was like the sound of blended flutes Blown by black players upon a picnic day. She sang and danced on gracefully and calm, The light gauze hanging loose about her form; To me she seemed a proudly-swaying palm Grown lovelier for passing through a storm. Upon her swarthy neck black shiny curls Luxuriant fell; and tossing coins in praise, The wine-flushed, bold-eyed boys, and even the girls, Devoured her shape with eager, passionate gaze; But looking at her falsely-smiling face, I knew her self was not in that strange place.
Down in the lowly valleys, by the rills, He said his simple prayers and made his moan; Then caught the sudden thunder of the hills And swayed the world--Heaven's eloquence his own! 
We who are dark And know the lash On bodies worn, Insensate made Through years of wrong; That feel no more The scourge, the whip-- We who are dark And know the hurt Of pitiless scorn On souls that live And feel the dart And thrust of wrong; The greedy glance Of sinful lust-- We who are dark And know the urge Of blinding rage And fury red, that eats and burns; the ache of hands Pressed on by hearts On vengeance bent-- We've won your praise That side by side With those who taught Us all our woes We bravely march Nor backward glance, Not hesitant, Nor slow, but with Quickening treat Old wrongs, old sores Forgotten lie; Brothers-in-arms, As we march forth To Victory, Bearing aloft To foreign lands A freedom sweet That's not our own.  
Tain't no need o' women worrin' bout dose sorry men Dey jest like a paper bag w'en it's full o' win'. Dey will call us sugar pie an' will treat us nice Till dey git us horn' wid dem fur to be dere wife. Things will go 'long very well fur a week or two Den you'll see 'em settin' 'round frownin' atter you; 'Tain't no need o' women worrin' 'bout dese sorry men, Dey jest like a paper bag w'en it's full o' win'.   See dem walkin' 'long wid you, holdin' to yo' arm— Don' you mind 'em, dat's a stunt, dey are full o' harm. Dey -kin tell de biggis' lies most you ever seen, An' kin pet an' honey you like you was a queen. One caught up wid me las' night, strutin' wid a cane, Rais'd 'is hat an' gin a bow, "How'd do Mis' Lizer Jane?" I didn't axe him how he done, which wus a hint to him Dat I perfer'd a paper bag w'en it's full o' win'.   You better keep yo' eyes on dem, dey'll fool you if dey kin', Den go eroun' an' make dere brag to all de other men; Dey'll come eroun' an' talk sweet talk an' dey won' let you res' But let 'em git you fur a wife, dey'll beat you outer bref; W'en you see dey ain't no good, jest let 'em pas' on by, Cause sho' as you fool 'long wid dem,—dem fools'll make you cry!

But w'at you think of Jacob Quinn,—he is mighty nice, An' you kno' I's promis' him I would be his wife; Let me stop my crazy talk, I kno' I love de men If dey are like a paper bag w'en it's full o' win'. 
Dedicated to the Ninety-Second Division, U. S. National Army  They shall go down unto Life's Borderland, Walk unafraid within that Living Hell,  Nor heed the driving rain of shot and shell That 'round them falls; but with uplifted hand Be one with mighty hosts, and armed band Against man's wrong to man- for such full well They know. And from their trembling lips shall swell A song of hope the world can understand.  All this to them shall be a glorious sign,  A glimmer of that Resurrection Morn,  When age-long Faith, crowned with a grace benign,  Shall rise and from their blows cast down the thorn.  Of Prejudice.  E'en through blood it be,  There breaks this day their dawn of Liberty. 
The rain is falling steadily, Bringing the earth relief; While dry-eyed I remain and calm, Amid my desert-grief.  Break! Break! ye flood-gates of mytears All pent in agony; Rain! rain! upon my thirsty soul, And flood it as the sea!  
Again it is the vibrant May,   The bursting buds, the leafing trees,    The toying fragrance of the breeze Call to my heart in subtlest way, Come! come, it is a holiday!  The streamlet with unending song,   Steals soft beneath a veiling mist,   As to some sweet alluring tryst-- While I, with inner surges strong, Find incomplete the day, and long.  Again it is the vibrant May,   The Springtime feror mocks my pain,   For I am thrall to wintry rain-- Fain would I turn my eyes away, For love alone brings holiday.  
Think ye I am not fiend and savage too? Think ye I could not arm me with a gun And shoot down ten of you for every one Of my black brothers murdered, burnt by you? Be not deceived, for every deed ye do I could match--out-match: am I not Afric's son, Black of that black where black deeds are done? But the Almighty from the darkness drew My soul and said: Even thou shalt be a light Awhile to burn on the benighted earth, Thy dusky face I set among the white For thee to prove thyself of highest worth; Before the world is swallowed up in night, To show thy little lamp; go forth! go forth!
We would not call you, Dunbar, from your rest, For you were weary when you sotfly sang The lullaby that soothed your love-sweet breast, And o'er the raptured world divinely rang, Amid the storms of Life's tumultuous clan, Of battle-thunders in the fateful Night That hide the smiles of Heaven from our sight;-- Lo, while you sleep the sleep of paradise We seek the blessed morning and its light 'Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes!'  ENVOY  Ah, Poet Paul! you ang and all is right! We feel our soulds expanding for the flight-- Lord, help us breathe to Thee a prayer and rise And touch Thy Truth Eternal on the Height. 'Ere sleep comes down to soothe the weary eyes!' 
I do not crave to have thee mine alone, dear, Keeping thy chamrs within my jealous sight; Go, give the world the blessing of thy beauty, That other hearts may share of my delight!  I do not ask, thy love should be mine only While others falter through the dreary night; Go, kiss the tears from some wayfarer's vision, That other eyes may know the joy of light!  Where days are sad and skies are hung with darkness, Go, send a smile that sunshine may be rife; Go, give a song, a word of kindly greeting, To ease the sorry of some lonely life! 
A little boy, lost in his childish play, Mid the deep'ning shades of the fading day, Fancied the warrior he would be; He scattered his foes with his wooden sword And put to fight a mighty horde-- Ere he crept to his daddy's knee. A soldier crawled o'er the death-stren plain, And he uttered the name of his love, in vain, As he stumbled over the crest; He fought with the fierceness of dark despair And drove the cowering for to his lair-- Ere he crept to his Father's breast.  
I had not thought of violets of late, The wild, shy kind that spring beneath your feet In wistful April days, when lovers mate And wander through the fields in rapturous sweet, The thought of violets meant florists’ shops, And bows and pins, and perfumed papers fine; And garish lights, and mincing little fops, And cabarets and songs, and deadenign wine. So far from the sweet real things my thoughts had strayed, I had forgot wide fields, and clear brown streams;  The perfect loveliness that God has made,-- Wild violets shy and Heaven-mounting dreams. And now–unwittingly, you’ve made me dream  Of violets and my soul’s forgotten gleam.
Father Love  ONE unto him does heaven grant to bend By day and night above the creamy cheek And dimpled smile of baby. 'Tis the meek, Sweet privilege of mother to attend The cradle shrine. There patience without end Wins her a beauty words can never speak. Her troubled joy has nothing more to seek Where life and love in one devotion blend.  For him the roughened world, all day for him The tyrant task, the tension of the mind. But toil were vain as any froth or foam, Were not that hour to come when twilight dim Brings weariness, and father turns to find Rest with the blessed angels of his home.
One  drop of midnight in the dawn of life's pulsating stream Marks her an alien from her kind, a shade amid its gleam Forevermore her step she bends, insular, strange, apart And none can read the riddle of her strangely warring heart. The stormy current of her blood, beats like a mighty sea Against the man-wrought iron bars of her captivity. For refuge, succor, peace and rest, she seeks that humble fold Whose every breath is kindliness, whose hearts are purest gold! 
Shall I say, “My son, you’re branded in this country’s pageantry, By strange subtleties you’re tethered, and no forum sets you free?” Shall I mark the young lights fading through your soul-enchannelled eye, As the dusky pall of shadows screen the highway of your sky?  Or shall I, with love prophetic, bid you dauntlessly arise. Spurn the handicap that clogs you, taking what the world denies, Bid you storm the sullen fortress wrought by prejudice and wrong With a faith that shall not falter, in your heart and on your tongue! 
These fell miasmic rings of mist, with ghoulish menace bound, Like noose-horizons tightening my little world around, They still the soaring will to wing, to dance, to speed away. And fling the soul insurgent back into its shell of clay:  Beneath incrusted silences, a seething Etna lies. The fire of whose furnaces may sleep — but never dies! 
I must not gaze at them although Your eyes are dawning day; I must not watch you as you go Your sun-illumined way;  I hear but I must never heed The fascinating note, Which, fluting like a river reed, Comes from your trembling throat;  I must not see upon your face Love’s softly glowing spark; For there’s the barrier of race, You’re fair and I am dark.
O whisper, O my soul! The afternoon Is waning into evening, whisper soft! Peace, O my rebel heart! for soon the moon From out its misty veil will swing aloft! Be patient, weary body, soon the night Will wrap thee gently in her sable sheet, And with a leaden sigh thou wilt invite To rest thy tired hands and aching feet. The wretched day was theirs, the night is mine; Come tender sleep, and fold me to thy breast. But what steals out the gray clouds red like wine? O dawn! O dreaded dawn! O let me rest Weary my veins, my brain, my life! Have pity! No! Once again the harsh, the ugly city.
If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, Making their mock at our accursed lot. If we must die, O let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!
Too green the springing April grass, Too blue the silver-speckled sky, For me to linger here, alas, While happy winds go laughing by, Wasting the golden hours indoors, Washing windows and scrubbing floors. Too wonderful the April night, Too faintly sweet the first May flowers, The stars too gloriously bright, For me to spend the evening hours, When fields are fresh and streams are leaping, Wearied, exhausted, dully sleeping.
I Lit with cheap colored lights a basement den, With rows of chairs and tables on each side, And, all about, young, dark-skinned women and men Drinking and smoking, merry, vacant-eyed. A Negro band, that scarcely seems awake, Drones out half-heartedly a lazy tune, While quick and willing boys their orders take And hurry to and from the near saloon. Then suddenly a happy, lilting note Is struck, the walk and hop and trot begin, Under the smoke upon foul air afloat; Around the room the laughing puppets spin To sound of fiddle, drum and clarinet, Dancing, their world of shadows to forget. II ’Tis best to sit and gaze; my heart then dances To the lithe bodies gliding slowly by, The amorous and inimitable glances That subtly pass from roguish eye to eye, The laughter gay like sounding silver ringing, That fills the whole wide room from floor to ceiling,— A rush of rapture to my tried soul bringing— The deathless spirit of a race revealing. Not one false step, no note that rings not true! Unconscious even of the higher worth Of their great art, they serpent-wise glide through The syncopated waltz. Dead to the earth And her unkindly ways of toil and strife, For them the dance is the true joy of life. III And yet they are the outcasts of the earth, A race oppressed and scorned by ruling man; How can they thus consent to joy and mirth Who live beneath a world-eternal ban? No faith is theirs, no shining ray of hope, Except the martyr’s faith, the hope that death Some day will free them from their narrow scope And once more merge them with the infinite breath. But, oh! they dance with poetry in their eyes Whose dreamy loveliness no sorrow dims, And parted lips and eager, gleeful cries, And perfect rhythm in their nimble limbs. The gifts divine are theirs, music and laughter; All other things, however great, come after.
Tis but a modern Roman holiday; Each state invokes its soul of basest passion, ​Each vies with each to find the ugliest way ​To torture Negroes in the fiercest fashion. ​Black Southern men, like hogs await your doom! White wretches hunt and haul you from your huts, ​They squeeze the babies out your women's womb, ​They cut your members off, rip out your guts! It is a Roman holiday, and worse, It is the mad beast risen from his lair, ​The dead accusing years' eternal curse. ​Reeking of vengeance, in fulfilment here. ​Bravo, Democracy! Hail greatest Power That saved sick Europe in her darkest hour!
An ugly figure, heavy, overfed, Settles uneasily into a chair; Nervously he mops his pink bald head, Frowns at the fawning waiter standing near. The entire service tries its best to please  This overpampered piece of broken-health, Who sits there thoughtless, querulous, obese, Wrapped in his sordid visions of vast wealth. Great God! if creatures like this money-fool, Who hold the service of mankind so cheap, Over the people must forever rule, Driving them at their will like helpless sheep— Then let proud mothers cease from giving birth; Let human beings perish from the earth.
The little peoples of the troubled earth,  The little nations that are weak and white;--- For them the glory of another birth, For them the lifting of the veil of night. The big men of the world in concert met, Have sent forth in their power a new decree: Upon the old harsh wrongs the sun must set, Henceforth the little peoples must be free! But we, the blacks, less than the trampled dust, Who walk the new ways with the old dim eyes,--- We to the ancient gods of greed and lust Must still be offered up as sacrifice: Oh, we who deign to live but will not dare, The white world's burden must forever bear!
Some day, when trees have shed their leaves,    And against the morning's white The shivering birds beneath the eaves    Have sheltered for the night, We'n turn our faces southward, love,    Toward the summer isle Where bamboos spire the shafted grove    And wide-mouthed orchids smile. And we will seek the quiet hill    Where towers the cotton tree, And leaps the laughing crystal rill,    And works the droning bee. And we will build a lonely nest    Beside an open glade, And there forever will we rest,    O love---O nut-brown maid!
Far-fame d the spot where Douglass dwelt, Here pilgrims oft have knelt    In homage to his noble fame,    With blessings on his name, And gratitude heart-felt.  And now before a double shrine, In praises we combine    With Douglass, great and wise and good,    Devoted womanhood— 'Round both our garlands twine . In union strong throughout the land, A consecrated band,    A service measureless they wrought    When Cedar Hill they bought And saved from alien hand.  Fear not, faint not, O sable race! The truth naught can efface    Is writ on ev'ry passing breeze;    With women such as these Our fight is won a-pace.  (Josephine T. Washington, “Cedar Hill Saved” in The Crisis, February 1919)
War  Mad oaths of iron heals, breath after breath,-- Hate thunder and its lightning doom of death To men. And all along the storm-torn trail, Slow-dying mothers moan and children wail!  Peace  Men prayed for Peace. War quaked the earth instead. But from the fields of righteous blood and tears, Where fought and fell mall millions, maimed and dead, Peace rose and reigned a thousand, thousand years.  
The New Year comes--fling wide, fling wide the door Of Opportunity! the spirit free To scale the utmost heights of hopes to be, To rest on peaks ne'er reached by man before! The boundless infinite let us explore, To search out undiscovered mystery, Undreamed of in our poor philosophy! The bounty of the gods upon us pour! Nay, in the New Year we shall be as gods: No longer apish puppets or dull clods Of clay; but poised, empowered to command, Upon the Etna of New Worlds we'll stand-- This scant earth-raiment to the winds will cast-- Full richly robed as supermen at last! 
I can remember when I was a little, young girl, how my old mammy would sit out of doors in the evenings and look up at the stars and groan, and I would say, ‘Mammy, what makes you groan so?’ And she would say, ‘I am groaning to think  of my poor children; they do not know where I be and I don’t know where they be. I look up at the stars and they look up at the stars!’ —Sojourner Truth  I think I see her sitting, bowed and black, Stricken and seared with slavery’s mortal scars, Reft of her children, lonely, anguished, yet Still looking at the stars.  Symbolic mother, we thy myriad sons, Pounding our stubborn hearts on Freedom’s bars, Clutching our birthright, fight with faces set, Still visioning the stars! 
The right to make my dreams come true, I ask, nay, I demand of life, Nor shall fate's deadly contraband Impede my steps, nor countermand; Too long my heart against the ground Has beat the dusty years around, And now at length I rise! I wake! And stride into the morning break! 
Fire—tears— And the torture-chamber, With the last maddening turn of the screw— Only thus Is one precious drop distilled Of the attar of rose
Through you, I entered heaven and hell,    Knew rapture and despair; I vaunted o'er the plains of earth    And scaled each shining stair. Drank deep the waters of content    And drained the cup of gall, Was regal and was impotent,    Was suzerain and thrall: Now by reflection's placid pool,   At evening's tranquil hour, I smile across the backward way    And pledge anew, my vow: For every glancing, golden gleam,    I offer, gladly, Pain; And i would give a thousand worlds,    To live it all again.  
All day within an upturned glass Of mist and clouds, the ghostly rains Streak down and listless winds that pass, Like vapor chilld on window panes. Gray threads of color blurred and purled, And streaming pencils tapering white,-- The autumn mood is on the world, And I am helpless in its might.  
All day the clouds    Grow cold and fall, And soft the white fleece shrouds   Field, hill and wall; And now I know   Why comes the snow: The bare black places lie   Too near the sky. 
What makes a nation truly great?  Not strength of arms, nor men of state, Nor vast domains, by conquest won, That knew not rise nor set of sun; Nor sophist's schools, nor learned clan, Nor laws that bind the will of man,-- For these have proved, in ages past, But futile dreams that could not last; And they that boast of such today, Are fallen, vanquished in the fray, Their glory mingled with the dust, Their archives stained with crime and lust; And all that breathed of pomp and pride, Like the untimely fig, has died. On thing, alone, restrains, exalts A nation and corrects its faults; One thin, alone, its life can crown And give its destiny renown. That nation, then, is truly great, That lives by love, and not by hate; That bends beneath the chastening rod, That owns the truth, and looks to God!  
Ah, how poets sing and die! Make one song and Heaven takes it; Have one heart and Beauty breaks it; Chatterton, Shelley, Keats and I-- Ah, how poets sing and die! 
Some grimy little newsboys Got in the car with me, And each one had a hockey-stick, And each was filled with glee. They jostled one another, Told tales of prowess done; One of them had a brother Who outrivalled everyone. And all the old men's faces, Around me in the train, Gazed on the wide green spaces Of their boyhood's joy again.  
The U.N.I.A. is a theme, Which millions are entwined With well wrought plans or business schemes, And brotherhood combined.   It means that all should fall in line, With the advancing guide: Responding to the sign of time, The new emblem of pride.   There are great adventures lie in wait, Make this a gorgeous year: Get out of that hesitating gate, The break of morn is near.   Our far off kin, of whom we’ve dreamed, Beyond the tossing wave: Await our coming to redeem The land, which God has gave.   About-face to that sunny shore! Where tyrants ruling bind: And hold enthralled, a stupid host Of untrained human mind.   In one procession let us charge! Forth with the lofty theme: ‘Till nations all salute the bark That bear, red, black and green.
Translated by Jessie Fauset  The lonely pool sleeps in the depth of the glade At the foot of a slope which its beauty discloses; And the whispering reeds make a rustling retreat Which the stream lips or leaves as it wakes or reposes.   The heather erects a dense rampart of green To conceal the sweet tide which reflects in its deeps The tops of tall trees, and this one labor done,   Forgetting aught else, dreams and placidly sleeps.  Now and then comes a bird—a blackcap or a swallow, Which with its swift flight makes the mute, formless hollow Of solitude ring with a shrill, plaintive sound.   Its wings barely skim the pool drowsy with slumber, Yet small, eager waves circling wide, without number, Haste to die 'mid the pitying reeds grouped around.  
God help the little colored child, And with her please abide, To help her bear the prejudice That comes from every side. Be with her in her daily toil, And when her work is o’er: Be with her when she goes to live Where sorrow is no more. No matter whither she may roam, She finds it hard to bear The taunting tongues of the unknown, Unless she has your care. It seems so hard to understand The attitude of those Who try to hurt another one, But oh, some day, who knows? A mighty battle may occur In honor of our right To live as other men will live. Are we to win the fight? O Lord a new hope we desire, To meet the other race, To let them see and know our hearts, And win a higher place! Oh, why have we been the oppressed? And suffered all in vain? Are we to have our equal rights? Are we to make the gain? Our eyes are open, and we see The wrongs done to our race. But when the battle has been fought, We’ll win a higher Grace.
At dusk when drowsy zephyrs blow,    My soul goes clad like Icarus, To genie lands of summer snow;    Rejuvenated impetus For laggard limbs is there; the lamp    Of far Cathay, my passive slave, Works mighty change in court and camp,    And none my ire have strength to brave. When silver rifts disturb the night    And herald light's diurnal reign, My airy oars my pleas requite    With disobedience; in vain Cajoleries and arts; once more    My lot to don the drab, dull husk You know; my golden wings I store    And wait the halcyon time of dusk. 
Mighty are your plans and deeds, After three and one-half year, Raging a warfare for the Negroes' need. Can the race not see or hear? Unity will give strength and  Success in redeeming the motherland. Go on, Garvey, fight for right; Attack the foes of our liberty. right must conquer and not might. Vouched for by God Almighty, Eternal shall be thy name Your posterity shall know your fame. 
What is so sad as when a poet dies Whose song was sweet and bold, whose face was black, Who audience ahd not evolved, alack! to cherish all he brought them from the skies? The swin has had a pearl. How few the eyes That followed him when on that horse's back he reared up throug the air that has no track, To where non but Apollo's darlings rise. He sang and "loved and lost," but nevermore Will such sad themes be his; for at the gate Of sweet Elysium he'll learn a song With raptures deeper than was his before High love of song admits one in that state Forever!--think, forever's very long. 
I've known rivers:  I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the       flow of human blood in human veins.  My soul has grown deep like the rivers.  I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young. I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it. I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln       went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy       bosom turn all golden in the sunset.  I've known rivers: Ancient, dusky rivers.  My soul has grown deep like the rivers. 
Sit here before my grate,  Until it's ashen gray, Or till the night grows late, And talk the time away.  I cannot think to sleep, And miss your golden speech, My bed of dreams will keep-- You here within my reach.  I have so much to say, The time is short at best, A bit of toil and play, And after that comes rest.  But you and I know now The wisdom of the soul, The years that seamed the brow Have made our visions whole.  Sit here before my grate, Until the ash is cold; The things you say of late Are fine as shriven gold. 
At first you’ll joy to see the playful snow, Like white moths trembling on the tropic air, Or waters of the hills that softly flow Gracefully falling down a shining stair.  And when the fields and streets are covered white And the wind-worried void is chilly, raw, Or underneath a spell of heat and light The cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw,  Like me you’ll long for home, where birds’ glad song Means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry, And tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong, Beneath a vivid silver-flecked blue sky.  But oh! more than the changeless southern isles, When Spring has shed upon the earth her charm, You’ll love the Northland wreathed in golden smiles By the miraculous sun turned glad and warm.
At night the wide and level stretch of wold, Which at high noon had basked in quiet gold, Far as the eye could see was ghostly white; Dark was the night save for the snow’s weird light.  I drew the shades far down, crept into bed; Hearing the cold wind moaning overhead Through the sad pines, my soul, catching its pain, Went sorrowing with it across the plain.  At dawn, behold! the pall of night was gone, Save where a few shrubs melancholy, lone, Detained a fragile shadow. Golden-lipped The laughing grasses heaven’s sweet wine sipped.  The sun rose smiling o’er the river’s breast, And my soul, by his happy spirit blest, Soared like a bird to greet him in the sky, And drew out of his heart Eternity.
Far from this foreign Easter damp and chilly      My soul steals to a pear-shaped plot of ground, Where gleamed the lilac-tinted Easter lily      Soft-scented in the air for yards around;  Alone, without a hint of guardian leaf!      Just like a fragile bell of silver rime, It burst the tomb for freedom sweet and brief      In the young pregnant year at Eastertime;  And many thought it was a sacred sign,      And some called it the resurrection flower; And I, a pagan, worshiped at its shrine,      Yielding my heart unto its perfumed power.
I would be wandering in distant fields Where man, and bird, and beast, lives leisurely, And the old earth is kind, and ever yields Her goodly gifts to all her children free; Where life is fairer, lighter, less demanding, And boys and girls have time and space for play Before they come to years of understanding – Somewhere I would be singing, far away. For life is greater than the thousand wars Men wage for it in their insatiate lust, And will remain like the eternal stars, When all that shines to-day is drift and dust But I am bound with you in your mean graves, O black men, simple slaves of ruthless slaves.
Although she feeds me bread of bitterness, And sinks into my throat her tiger’s tooth, Stealing my breath of life, I will confess I love this cultured hell that tests my youth! Her vigor flows like tides into my blood, Giving me strength erect against her hate. Her bigness sweeps my being like a flood. Yet as a rebel fronts a king in state, I stand within her walls with not a shred Of terror, malice, not a word of jeer. Darkly I gaze into the days ahead, And see her might and granite wonders there, Beneath the touch of Time’s unerring hand, Like priceless treasures sinking in the sand.
Oh when I think of my long-suffering race, For weary centuries despised, oppressed, Enslaved and lynched, denied a human place In the great life line of the Christian West; And in the Black Land disinherited, Robbed in the ancient country of its birth, My heart grows sick with hate, becomes as lead, For this my race that has no home on earth. Then from the dark depths of my soul I cry To the avenging angel to consume The white man’s world of wonders utterly: Let it be swallowed up in earth’s vast womb, Or upward roll as sacrificial smoke To liberate my people from its yoke!
I  All night, through the eternity of night, Pain was my portion though I could not feel. Deep in my humbled heart you ground your heel, Till I was reft of even my inner light, Till reason from my mind had taken flight, And all my world went whirling in a reel. And all my swarthy strength turned cold like steel, A passive mass beneath your puny might. Last night I gave you triumph over me, So I should be myself as once before, I marveled at your shallow mystery, And haunted hungrily your temple door. I gave you sum and substance to be free, Oh, you shall never triumph any more!  II I do not fear to face the fact and say, How darkly-dull my living hours have grown, My wounded heart sinks heavier than stone, Because I loved you longer than a day! I do not shame to turn myself away From beckoning flowers beautifully blown, To mourn your vivid memory alone In mountain fastnesses austerely gray. The mists will shroud me on the utter height, The salty, brimming waters of my breast Will mingle with the fresh dews of the night To bathe my spirit hankering to rest. But after sleep I’ll wake with greater might, Once more to venture on the eternal quest.
My spirit wails for water, water now! My tongue is aching dry, my throat is hot For water, fresh rain shaken from a bough, Or dawn dews heavy in some leafy spot. My hungry body’s burning for a swim In sunlit water where the air is cool, As in Trout Valley where upon a limb The golden finch sings sweetly to the pool. Oh water, water, when the night is done, When day steals gray-white through the window-pane, Clear silver water when I wake, alone, All impotent of parts, of fevered brain; Pure water from a forest fountain first, To wash me, cleanse me, and to quench my thirst!
Far down, down through the city’s great, gaunt gut The gray train rushing bears the weary wind; In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut, Leaving the sick and heavy air behind. And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door To give their summer jackets to the breeze; Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas; Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep, Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift Lightly among the islands of the deep; Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white That lend their perfume to the tropic sea, Where fields lie idle in the dew drenched night, And the Trades float above them fresh and free.
Into the furnace let me go alone; Stay you without in terror of the heat. I will go naked in–for thus ’tis sweet— Into the weird depths of the hottest zone. I will not quiver in the frailest bone, You will not note a flicker of defeat; My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet, My mouth give utterance to any moan. The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears; Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name. Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears, Transforming me into a shape of flame. I will come out, back to your world of tears, A stronger soul within a finer frame.
When June comes dancing o’er the death of May, With scarlet roses tinting her green breast, And mating thrushes ushering in her day, And Earth on tiptoe for her golden guest,  I always see the evening when we met─ The first of June baptized in tender rain─ And walked home through the wide streets, gleaming wet, Arms locked, our warm flesh pulsing with love’s pain.  I always see the cheerful little room, And in the corner, fresh and white, the bed, Sweet scented with a delicate perfume, Wherein for one night only we were wed;  Where in the starlit stillness we lay mute, And heard the whispering showers all night long, And your brown burning body was a lute Whereon my passion played his fevered song.  When June comes dancing o’er the death of May, With scarlet roses staining her fair feet, My soul takes leave of me to sing all day A love so fugitive and so complete. 
Upon thy purple mat thy body bare Is fine and limber like a tender tree. The motion of thy supple form is rare, Like a lithe panther lolling languidly, Toying and turning slowly in her lair. Oh, I would never ask for more of thee; Thou art so clean in passion and so fair. Enough! if thou wilt ask no more of mel
Your scent is in the room. Swiftly it overwhelms and conquers me! Jasmines, night jasmines, perfect of perfume, Heavy with dew before the dawn of day! Your face was in the mirror. I could see You smile and vanish suddenly away, Leaving behind the vestige of a tear. Sad suffering face, from parting grown so dear! Night jasmines cannot bloom in this cold place; Without the street is wet and weird with snow; The cold nude trees are tossing to and fro; Too stormy is the night for your fond face, For your low voice too loud the wind's mad roar. But Oh, your scent --- jasmines, jasmines. that grow Luxuriant, clustered round your cottage door!
Since Poets have told of sunset,  What is left for me to tell? I can only say that I saw the day Press crimson lips to horizon gray, And kiss the earth farewell. 
If someone should make me an offer Of something dear and real And which should be a token good and true: Something to suit my color. And gives a hue for all, I think I’ll choose the rainbow, wouldn’t you? Give me the rainbow, The sign that is so true. And let me take my color And leave the rest for you. For all of such, you find so much. So give me the rainbow true No token is more truer: No emblem can be so dear; The one true sign of promise we are told. And if I have the rainbow Life sorrows when it rains Will find the rainbow sucking free and bold.
My fallen star has spent its night And left but memory to me; My day of dream has kissed the night. Farewell: its sun no more I see: My summer bloomed for winter's front; Alas I've lived and loved and lost! What matters if today should earth  Lay on my head a gold-bright crown Lit with gems of royal worth Befitting well a king's renown?-- My lonely soul is trouble-tossed,  For I have lived and loved and lost! Great God! I dare not question Thee-- Thy way eternally is just; This seeming mystery to me Will be revealed if I but trust: Ah, Thou alone dost know the cost When one has lived and loved and lost! 
Kingdoms wide that sit in darkness Grant them, Lord, Thy glorious light. And from Eastern coast to Western May the morning chase the night--    And redemption Freely purchased win the day. 
His ways are circumspect and bound With trite simplicities; His is the grace of comforts found In homely hearthside ease. His words are sage and fall with care, Because he loves me so; And being his, he knows, I fear, The dizzy path I go. For he was once as young as I, As prone to take the trail, To find delight in the sea’s low cry, And a lone wind’s lonely wail. It is his eyes that tell me most How full his life has been; There lingers there the faintest ghost Of some still sacred sin. So I must quaff Life’s crazy wine, And taste the gall and dregs; And I must spend this wealth of mine, Of vagrant wistful legs; And I must follow, follow, follow The lure of a silver horn, That echoes from a leafy hollow, Where the dreams of youth are born. Then when the star has shed its gleam, The rose its crimson coat; When Beauty flees the hidden dream, And Pan’s pipes blow no note; When both my shoes are worn too thin, My weight of fire to bear, I’ll turn like dad, and like him win The peace of a snug arm-chair. 
Shake your brown feet, honey, Shake your brown feet, chile, Shake your brown feet, honey, Shake 'em swift and wil'    Get way back, honey,    Do that low-down step.    Walk on over, darling,       Now! Come out       With your left. Shake your brown feet, honey, Shake 'em, honey chile.  Sun's going down this evening-- Might never rise no mo'. The sun's going down this very night Might never rise no mo'-- So dance with swift feet, honey,    (The banjo's sobbing low) Dance with swift feet, honey--    Might never dance no mo'.  Shake your brown feet, Liza, Shake 'em, Liza, chile, Shake your brown feet, Liza,    (The music's soft and wil') Shake your brown feet, Liza,    (The banjo's sobbing low) The sun's going down this very night Might never rise no mo'. 
Well, son, I'll tell you: Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, And splinters, And boards torn up, And places with no carpet on the floor Bare. But all the time I'se been a-climbin' on, And reachin' landin's, And turnin' corners, And sometimes goin' in the dark Where there ain't been no light. So boy, don't you turn back. Don't you set down on the steps 'Cause you finds it's kinder hard . Don't you fall now For I'se still goin', honey, I'se still climbin', And life for me ain't been no crystal stair. 
Ah! let me rest, when I have done, Beneath a warming, stirring sun, Beneath a flower-studded sod That shows the smiling face of God. In kindly earth that comfort gave, A kindly couch where dreams the brave, Where longing hurries weeping grief, where halting goes the gilded chief. Sweet spring will trail a bridal veil, Grim frost shall lose his howl and wail, And summer flowers deck my breast  And sunlight gild me from the west. But I shall rise with verdant spring, And I shall speak when song-birds sing,  And laughing ripple in the streams, And flit and flicker on the beams. Ah! let me rest when I have done. When I my earthly course have run, And wake me not to shame or blame, Nor stir my dust with flore of flame. 
When night opens her shining eyes    And spreads her velvet gown, She softly paints the purple skies    In grays of cloudy down. 
When I look back  On days already lived I am content. For I have laughed  With the dew of morn, The calm of night; With the dawn of youth And spring's bright days. Mid-summer's bloom  And autumn's ripening glory My youth rejoiced.  And when winter bleak Spread melancholy 'round I still smiled on. And I have loved With quivering arms that Clung, and throbbing breast-- With all the white-hot blood Of mating's flaming urge. My cool, white soul Has oft fared forth In Astral ways, for none may lag When star dust hides the earth. The wing of dreams  Have swept me up To touch my feed on cloud And wander where none But souls dare climb. 
Whence come I to this world of stife, This sphere of love, this vale of sighs? What called me to this form of life, This street of truth, this trough of lies? Where shall I go when I have done? Will nothingness my soul then claim? Must naught come of the struggles won? Shall I be called to praise or blame? But, let me question as I will, Enthralling silence answers me. My whence is hidden to me still, My hence is wrapped in mystery.
Don't knock on my door, little child,    I cannot let you in; You know not what a world this is    Of cruelty and sin. Wait in the still eternity    Until I come to you. The world is cruel, cruel, child,    I cannot let you through.  Don't knock at my heart, little one,    I cannot bear the pain    Of turning deaf ears to your call, Time and time again.    You do not know the monster men Inhabiting the earth,    Be still, be still, my precious child,    I cannot give you birth. 
We lift a son to you across the day Which bears through travailing, the seed you spread In terror's morning, flung with fingers red In blood of tyrants, who debarred the way To Freedom's dawning. Hearken to the lay Chanted by dusky millions, soft and mellow-keyed In minor measure, Martyr of the Freed, A song of memory across the Day!  Truth cannot perish, though the earth erase The royal emblems, leaving not a trace; And time still burgeoneth the fertile seed Though he is crucified who wrought the deed: O, Alleghanies, fold him to your breast Until the Judgment! Sentinel his rest! 
Pour O pour that parting soul in song, O pour it in the sawdust glow of night, Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night, And let the valley carry it along. And let the valley carry it along.  O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree, So scant of grass, so profligate of pines, Now just before an epoch’s sun declines Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee, Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.  In time, for though the sun is setting on A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set; Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone, Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.  O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums, Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air, Passing, before they stripped the old tree bare One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes  An everlasting song, a singing tree, Caroling softly souls of slavery, What they were, and what they are to me, Caroling softly souls of slavery.
I stand in awe and . . . Bow my head in shame That in this land of boasted. Free, nntrampled justice And Christian Rule —so called— Lynching still holds sway!  Oh, ye ! whose blood has . . . Not turned yellow, but — Still runs crimson, as in Mother's sacred womb, Can ye, with inborn conscience Give "unwritten" Lynch Law— room?  I dare say: "No!" No self-respecting mortal Who loves humanity and Submits to white man's "written" laws. Condones such jackal, cut-throat practice, That chokes great Lincoln's aim with . . . "Hyena Claws!"  Yet, notwithstanding all, Our black boys fought like heroes To save this white man's country From an unknown foreign foe. Their noble deeds were heralded by allies In France, in Belgium and in England too.  The beaten foe himself, Feels conscience-bound to honor The black man's valor and his daring deeds ; But Southland . . . Home !—with Houston —    Texas leading. Insults parading heroes on return; Oh, Shame!  What then? Some heart-sick boys resented The unjust treatment meted out to them. When quickly organized a rabble, ready For record-breaking savage cruelty, And hanged the boys that risked their lives for them.  Thirteen souls of colored Martyrs, Freed and gone before their Master, Pleading Justice, Justice only! For their people, who, though black Gave their loved ones to the country; "Colored people do not slack."  God. who calls all men His children. Asking Race or Creed of none, Said, He made us in His Image! Surely! Justice will be done! Southland! Take the "White Voice" warning, Grant it, ere God's Curse has come.
How strange that grass should sing— Grass is so still a thing ... And strange the swift surprise of snow So soft it falls and slow. 
O Life --- triumphant Life, thy upward ways Unfold to men of lofty moods, To men who hear, and having heard, Respond full freely to the higher call. As in the primal day of gray-green Earth, When flowers all colorless, and songless birds, And Man --- half brute, Caught color, song and soul-hint From out the realm of Nature's sovereignty,- So for thy richer quality, O Life, Some men have yearned, and yearning, Found it near. O Life --- triumphant Life, thy gleaming heights Are reached by men of vision clear, By men who have keen sense of sound-and sight, Who do not climb to belfry towers Amid the tumult of discordant clang, Nay, rather do they seek a place removed, Where clang and tumult blend ami make The music of the climes. Calm-souled, nor courting human praise, They feel the urge-they hold out helping hands, And upward keep their way. O Life --- triumphant Life, thou art achieved By all who throw off low desire, And from the chrysalis of self Emerge, and rising, aid their kind, Unlike some rare old instrument. Long laid aside-with silent stringslts quality made useless by decay They give their best, they open doors of Hope, They grow to fitness through the commonplace, Until, their souls enriched, they feel The pulse-beats of a new Normality. 
Down thro' the open windows of my soul Pours the changing glory of a Setting Sun, And rays, all crimson, gold and violet, Play with Aeolian sweetness across Life's Memories, Commingling, blending into Haunting Melodies Of the Hours that I have known In this Life's passing Day. And, after crimson, gold and violet Give place to Twilight, soft and soothing Twilight, Lo, to my waiting soul Comes down the calm of Night, The closing of the Day, The promised Hour of Rest. And then? behold! 'tis Morn! Freshness and fragrance everywhere! Out of the open windows of my soul, I gaze Upon the glistening Dew-drops of Assurance, Foretelling the endlessness of immortality. Around me and beyond, are fairest fields Of rich Fulfillment, Above, plane after plane of rare Attainment. My dreams have ripened into blest Realities, Here in the long-looked-for Realm Of Life Supreme.
Vainly you wonder why sun, moon and star,-- Pageant illuminate,-- Never disclose what their destinies are; Seldom reveal what their distances bar. Mysteries fascinate.  Then, maybe you err when you try to unfold All that my heart would speak– Better the faith of the knight of old, Ending his quest with a cup of gold– Love is the boon I seek. 
This will I say today, Let no tomorrow come; Thy words are singing birds That strike my faint lyre dumb.  This will I vow thee now, Lest vows should go unsaid: Thou art unto my heart A song to wake the dead.  This oath I take to break When falls the lover's code: To fare as thou, and share With thee each winding road.  Thus do I deal my seal, No alien one may break: Thy mouth to mine as south The long lone trail we take.  
They talk the silent night away,    But speak no word by day; One is a cedar trim and tall,    His love a willow small. The one stands proud with head held high,    The other, coyly shy; The cedar's limbs are hard and strong;    The willow's voice is song. By day when she would love to talk    Across the garden walk,  The cedar's rude as rude can be,    Pretending not to see; And then the willow turns away,    And sulks throughout the day; Sometimes she gives a little sigh,    And once I saw her cry. At night when our harsh words are said,    And I am in my bed, I hear in sweetest harmonies    The language of those trees.  I find the ivied balcony,    Where through the gloom I see  Two sweethearts in the yard below    Whose speech all lovers know. 
I have just seen a most beautiful thing: Slim and still Against a golod, gold sky, A straight, black cypress Sensitive Exquisitie A black finger Pointing upwards, Why, beautiful still finger, are you black? And why are you pointing upwards? 
Trouncing tyrants and traitors. Hampering henchmen and haters, Erecting enlightenment's empire. Messenger of merit and manliness, Emancipating the enslaved; Symbol of sane salvation; Scorning slavish surrender; Emblazoning economic enlightenment; Nemesis of a nasty nation; Grinding the great and the grovelling; Exacting eternal equality; Rearing the ramparts of reason.
Their floors are cribs of ants and bugs — I mean the folks of Ruthlessville — Beneath each bed are liquor jugs; Narcotic dirt their corners fill. I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.  Their cupboards smell of musty foods, Their wealth leans to a wanton use. They swell their breasts with heartless moods And leave the coils of virtue loose. I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.  They squint an eye at aims sublime, In blowing bubbles they have push. A trifle grinds away their time; They breathe an artificial wish; I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.  Their mode of life is like the bears'— Blind to the energy of truth. Their thumbs are down on him who cares; They hurt him like an aching tooth. I mean the folks of Ruthlessville.
I saw the sunset yesterday Behind the gold and purple west. My soul's a richer soul for aye, Because upon my heart was pressed Its dream-inspiring souvenir. Last June when roses were in bloom, I saw one rare one in the dew. My heart beats faster, I presume, Because it was so simply new — So supra-sweet its atmosphere. I hear men praying to behold Some far-off glory, and to share Some city built of finest gold; But why should I have business there, If it be lovelier than here? If I'm too crude to entertain The joy that's made for me on earth. Would not you think me basely vain To build a bridge across its worth In search of something lovelier? And I can count them by the score, — Those beauties that have touched my life. The souls untouched by them are poor; And they will help you in the strife Who are our civic pioneer.
However hard the winds may blow, However strong the tides may flow, Though lightning flash and thunders peal, We trust the Master at the wheel. Driven by storms to veer and tack, He never turns the good ship back, But rights her heel, and evermore Fares forward to the distant shore. Poor children of the human race, Far voyaging through time and space, How hard beset, how driven wide On angry seas by wind and tide! But high above the streaming years The faithful lodestar Truth appears, And thitherwards through tempests still Trembles the compass of Good-will. Faith in the Master, and mankind Some day beyond the flood will find, When dark and wind and peril cease, The shining harbor shores of Peace. 
We should have a land of sun, Of gorgeous sun, And a land of fragrant water Where the twilight Is a soft bandanna handkerchief Of rose and gold, And not this land where life is cold.  We should have a land of trees, Of tall thick trees Bowed down with chattering parrots Brilliant as the day, And not this land where birds are grey.  Ah, we should have a land of joy, Of love and joy and wine and song, And not this land where joy is wrong.  Oh, sweet, away! Ah, my beloved one, away!
Oh, silver tree! Oh, shining rivers of the soul!  In a Harlem cabaret Six long-headed jazzers play. A dancing girl whose eyes are bold Lifts nigh a dress of silken gold.  Oh, singing tree! Oh, shining rivers of the soul!  Were Eve's eyes In the first garden Just a bit too bold? Was Cleopatra gorgeous In a gown of gold?  Oh, shining tree! Oh, silver rivers of the soul!  In a whirling cabaret Six long-headed jazzers play. 
Does a jazz-band ever sob? They say a jazz-band's gay. Yet as the vulgar dancers whirled And the wan night wore away, One said she heard the jazz-band sob When the little dawn was grey. 
One who sings "chansons vulgaires" In a Harlem cellar Where the jazz-band plays From dark to dawn Would not understand Should you tell her That she is like a nymph For some wild faun. 
How thin and sharp is the moon tonight! How thin and sharp and ghostly white Is the slim curved crook of the moon tonight! 
We should have a land of sun, Of gorgeous sun, And a land of fragrant water Where the twilight Is a soft bandanna handkerchief Of rose and gold, And not this land where life is cold. We should have a land of trees, Of tall thick trees Bowed down with chattering parrots Brilliant as the day, And not this land where birds are grey. Ah, we should have a land of joy, Of love and joy and wine and song, And not this land where joy is wrong. Oh, sweet, away! Ah, my beloved one, away!
Today like yesterday Tomorrow like today; The drip, drip, drip,         Of monotony Is wearing my life away; Today like yesterday, Today like today.  
Life's little hour is fleet, so fleet But love's is fleeter still, So let us lift the chalice dear And drink, and drink until The shadows lengthen to repose And fierce desires still, Then may our souls view tranquilly The low-light o'er the hill!
Lyrist of the solemn hour, Day's onfall brings thy power With a deluge of delight All enravishing the night.  
I love old faces mellow wise, That smile; their young-od laughing eyes Undimmed, still view, in sheer pretense Of youth, their own sweet innocence.  I love old hands that trembling bless Youth's wild impetuous duress; That find in childhood's tangled cares, Life's answers to unuttered prayers.  Old things to me are dear and best; Old faith--that after life is rest; That somehow, from above our will, God works His gracious marvels still.  
Oh that last night I said I did not care, But I was fretful from an angry sting; And in my petulance was unaware  Of what great change a few hours' thought would bring. Now you are gone, my days are bleak and long And vacant as a sail-deserted sea; Silent is my poor heart's divinest song, Dead all those dreams of hope that lived with me.  
Oh! you children of a despised race Of dark and saffron hue; Stop building mansions in the sky To be occupied by you.  Your quest should be for mansions here, For self, for home, for race, That you can give posterity That high and fitting place.  Placid content is a fool's paradise It unfits the mind. Face facts, bold and courageously, Be implacable; the resolute kind.  Never submerge your manhood, Always resent insults, If anyone regard you highly Such methods they repulse.  Be a bulldog in the fight Never be a cur, The bulldog no one ever kicks, Instinctively they fear.  The fight is on! The enemy is here; Would you know how to beat 'em? The solution is plain, a cogent fact, Join the Friends of Negro Freedom.
Sleep, little son! Rest, ebon head!    Sad, your mother mourns your soldier-father dead, Who on the soil of France bravely fought and bled;--    Sleep! Sleep! When grim and grewsome War took its terrific toll    And grey Grief filled the heart with sorrowing of soul, He answered then the call fo the world for Freedom's right.    Sleep, little son! Good-night. Shade of my dead! Oh warrior one!    Watch from you realm upon our little son. Teach him that you died that all might rise and run;    Watch! Watch! Make for him a place in the world's new March of Man; And be, oh spirit fine, his leader in the van. Ah grant, dear husband mine, your sad wife's fond request;    Rest warrior one! Then rest! Sleep, little son! Sleep, little son! I pray your Living Lord that victory is won; That all the daring deed by our dear soldier done--    Deeds done-- Up to the throne of God will rise in surging Throngs Holding high hands to Heav'n to right a Race's wrongs,-- Mind not, my darling son, your mother's eyes that weep:    Sleep, little son! Now sleep! 
The wind was a care-free soul      That broke the chains of earth,  And strode for a moment across the land     With the wild halloo of his mirth. He little cared that he ripped up trees,      That houses fell at his hand,  That his step broke calm on the breast of seas,      That his feet stirred clouds of sand.  But when he had had his little joke,      Had shouted and laughed and sung,  When the trees were scarred, their branches broke,      And their foliage aching hung,  He crept to his cave with a stealthy tread,      With rain-filled eyes and low-bowed head.
"They jest at scars who never felt a wound," They speak of love who never sensed the "thrill," They grind out verse, who'se lyre was ne'er attuned, To meet the edict of the pop'lar will.  They dream of wealth and fame on heights sublime, Although in truth, they never had amount, Or held in trust, the item of a dime To swell the coffers of a bank-account.  They babble war, who never held a gun. They talk of thrift who never saved a cent; They shout: "Fair Play," but make a good safe run, When ranging landlords come to get their rent.  They want good service, 'though they never gave, The eager, willing bell-hop lugging bags, A thin and lonely dime, his soul to save, Or starved street-beggars in their tattered rags.  They play at stocks, and in a sprawling hand, They write out checks, who'se funds have long been nil, At last, the Boss gets "hep" and out they land ; Because they cannot pay their hotel-bill.  They boast of fights who never graced a glove, They picture goals, they think they will attain, They dream not dreams, and do not know whereof They build these fairy castles in their brain.  They prate of Peace who never strove to be Staunch guardians of the Brotherhood of Man; They shout aloud, for "World Democracy!" But brand with shame each universal plan.  They daily wail of wrongs beyond the sea, While here, defenceless Negroes writhe and burn; Great GodI What will the awful tribute be, That day when Black Men get their just return?
Lone and dismal; hushed and dark, Upon the waves floats and empty bark.  The stars go out; the raindrops fall, And through the night comes a ghostly call--  My lone and dismal life's a-float Upon the seas like an empty boat.  Above the heights where the sea-gulls soar, The thunder lifts its resonant roar.  Like a jagged arrow a flash is sent, That splits the clouds with a double rent.  And just beyond my bark that drifts, Moonbeams steal through the kindly rifts.  
I have found thee in the soft shadows of twilight When the stars blink sleepily At the glowing, defiant Sun-King Who sinks slowly, reluctantly Behind the craggy hill tops. I have heard thee in the still Silence of early morning When the new day creeps stealthily Out of oblivion, to gaze on Black spires, snorting smoke-stacks Bent and tired workers.
Streams of them pour out incessantly From dismal hovels; Blank expressioned, mutely pleading For strength to bear their weazened frames Forth to their prisons and back to their huts : But they are drones, only drones— So it matters not.
The trees are sighing and swaying In mournful rhythm To the moaning melodies Of the comfortless wind. Low and uncertain their dirge continues In awful persistence For those who are dying tonight.
O, fathomless pall that enshrouds me, O, infinite power that binds me. I cannot escape thee, O night, night! My spirit submits to thee, My soul cries out to thee, Thy power enslaveth me, O night, night! I search for some solace of woes, I seek for calm and repose, Thy mystic murmurs console me, O night, night!
I wonder if the stars ever tire of Watching broken-hearted beings, Crushed flowers or weeping children, Or does their brilliance make them blind ?
I no longer crave for beauty, What there was in me that craved is dead. And now I move among the flowers Insensate, waiting to hear her call.
Your smile is like a misty day, Mysterious, enchanting, alluring. Your voice is like a gentle rain, Refreshing, enticing and soothing.
A rainy day is an eerie day When elfins skip blithely o'er puddles and pools, But mere human folk plod sulkily Wishing for sunny days When the rust's off the tools.
That night she felt those searching hands Grip deep upon her breast, She laughed and sang a silly tune To lull her babe to rest;  That night she kissed his coral lips How could she know the rest?  1924 version:   That night I felt His searching hands    Grip deep upon my breast, I laughted ans sang a silly tune    About a golden quest; That night I kissed his coral lips,--    How could I know the rest? 
Surely as I hold your in mine, As surely as your crinkled hair belies The enamoured sun pretending that he dies While still he loiters in its glossy shine, As surely as I break the slender line That spider linked us with, in no least wise Am I uncertain that these alien skies Do not our whole life measure and confine. No less, once in a land of scarlet suns And brooding winds, before the hurricane Bore down upon us, long before this pain, We found a place where quiet water runs; I held your hand this way upon a hill, And felt my heart forebear, my pulse grow still.
I have a rendezvous with Life, In days I hope will come, Ere youth has sped, and strength of mind, Ere voices sweet grow dumb. I have a rendezvous with Life, When Spring's first heralds hum. Sure some would cry it's better far To crown their days with sleep Than face the road, the wind and rain, To heed the calling deep. Though wet nor blow nor space I fear, Yet fear I deeply, too, Lest Death should meet and claim me ere I keep Life's rendezvous.
I have no fancy for that ancient cant That makes us masters of our destinies, And not our lives, to hold or give them up As will directs; I cannot, will not think That men, the subtle worms, who plot and plan And scheme and calculate with such shrewd wit, Are such great blund'ring fools as not to know When they have lived enough. Men court not death When there are sweets still left in life to taste. Nor will a brave man choose to live when he, Full deeply drunk of life, has reached the dregs, And knows that now but bitterness remains. He is the coward who, outfaced in this, Fears the false goblins of another life. I honor him who being much harassed Drinks of sweet courage until drunk of it,-- Then seizing Death, reluctant, by the hand, Leaps with him, fearless, to eternal peace!
Slanting, driving, Summer rain How you wash my heart of pain! How you make me think of trees, Ships and gulls and flashing seas! In your furious, tearing wind, Swells a chant that heals my mind; And your passion high and proud, Makes me shout and laugh aloud!  Autumn rains that start at dawn, ‘Dropping veils of thinnest lawn’; Soaking sod between dank grasses, Sweeping golden leaves in masses,- Blotting, blurring out the Past, In a dream you hold me fast; Calling, coaxing to forget Thing that are, for things not yet.  Winter tempest, winter rain, Hurtling down with might and main, You but make me hug my heart, Laughing, sheltered from your wrath. Now I woo my dancing fire, Piling, piling drift-wood higher. Books and friends and pictures old, Hearten while you pound and scold!  Pattering wistful showers of Spring Set me to remembering Far-off times and lovers too, Gentle joys and heart-break rue,- Memories I’d as lief forget, Were not oblivion sadder yet. Ah! you twist my mind with pain, Wistful whispering April rain!  Summer, Autumn, Winter rain, How you ease my heart of pain! Whispering, wistful showers of Spring, How I love the hurt you bring! 
This town that yesterday was dark and mean,    And dank and raw with Winter's freezing air, Is Light itself today, and verdant Sheen    Gold-tinted, and besprent with perfume rare; Translated over night to a parterre    That makes me dream of Araby and Spain, And all the healing places of the Earth,    Where one lays by his woe, his bitter pain,       For peace and mirth.  II  Old Winter that stayed by us black and drear,    And laid his blighting seal on everything, Is vanished.-—Is it true he once was here?--    Mark how the ash-trees bud, and children sing, And birds set up a faint, shy jargoning;    And healing balm pours out from bole and leaf. For Spring—sweet April's here in tree and grass!    Oh foolish heart to fret so with your grief!       This too shall pass!  
My heart that was so passionless Leapt high last night when I saw you! Within me surged the grief of years And whelmed me with its endless rue. My heart that slept so still, so spent, Awoke last night,—to break anew! 
If I were a doe in a forest deep, I could lift my soft brown eyes to weep, Weep silent, crystal tears. At a still, cool pool 'neath some woodbird's nest, I could pause and drink and bathe and rest, Rest in a sad, sweet peace. But I'm not a doe in a forest deep; Here soft brown eyes must smile, not weep, And the pool is far away.
Twin stars through my purpling pane, The shriveling husk Of a yellowing moon on the wane,—
— — I weep — — Not as the young do noisily, Not as the aged rustily, But quietly. Drop by drop the great tears Splash upon my hands, And save you saw them shine, You would not know
Little grey dreams, I sit at the ocean’s edge, At the grey ocean’s edge,  With you in my lap. I launch you, one by one,     And one by one,       Little grey dreams, Under the grey, grey, clouds, Out on the grey, grey, sea,  You go sailing away,  From my empty lap,       Little grey dreams. Sailing! Sailing! Into the black, At the horizon’s edge.
Because my face is brown    They say I may not dream Of triumph and renown.    What know they of life's scheme? Ah, bend, bend far the bow—    The arrow farther flies. Press down my soul and, lo,    My dreams shall range the skies.
My loftier songs may never see the light, Though fine as what some pompous bard can make. Here's one inspired by the stomachache Incurred by eating peanuts yesternight. But luck can't hide the sparks, for sparks are bright And should, because of darkness, win the cake, (As Dunbar showed you in his glittering wake) So fame again might treat song's victim white. No Muses can rebel stomach rule; She'll force them to the bread and cabbage class; Thin walls divide the martyr and the fool, And death is less inviting than the crass ; I'm dragged into maudlin cabbage school Because none had the heart to sound the brass.
On Pegasus you've flown into a sheen — A glorious passion has possessed your tongue. You moved old doctors with your lispings, strung Harplike, awaking melodies serene. Though in this moon when conscious song seems lean,- And bends to prose, your steed with wings outflung, Veils the Plebeian quills ;—wreath-hemmed while young As Byron was, or Dunbar, at nineteen. Your diapasons fill Apollo's skies; Yet, when his restless Nine encircle you, For pennyroyal sinks your hooked line, You tonic us mid pleasure and surprise . . . So I one of your patients credit you For songs like meat, like medicine, like wine.
The Song of Psyche  Hark this message I bring, in this carol I sing, From a song that I heard in the park. 'Twasn't trammelled in word, for it came from a bird; 'Twas divined from the notes of a lark  Dreams Are the Workman's Friends  Dreams are the workman's friends. Their rapture can Awake his spirits better than old wines ; To 'waken him to beauty is their plan; They bring him rubies from remote confines.    Dreams are the workman's friends.  I daily hang my latchstrings out of doors For them. They throw conditions to the winds. They find me lighting lamps or tinting floors; And yet they greet me like old-fashioned friends.    Dreams are the workman's friends.  Forsooth, the elves of limbo leave my camp, They jostle in confusion in retreat. My rapture drives them onward like a lamp Drives on the dark before the pilgrim's feet.    Dreams are the workman's friends.  They bring me mingled rapture o'er the crest, That once behind horizons hid away. Their gift of rapture burns within my breast Like twilight beams that love the dying day.    Dreams are the workman's friends.   My Motive  Should you who listen to my flute Conclude 'twere best if I were mute, Or should you doubt that I have won The wreath of praise, the glad "well done"; If you some better verse have read, My soul would still be comforted :— For though I limitations feel. Love, strangling judgment, made me kneel, — Constrained by reverence, not conceit — To vent my soul at Beauty's feet.
I do not hate you, For your faces are beautiful, too. I do not hate you, Your faces are whirling lights of loveliness and splendor, too. Yet why do you torture me, O, white strong ones, Why do you torture me?
The haunting face of poverty, The hands of pain, The rough, gargantuan feet of fate, The nails of conscience in a soul That didn't want to do wrong---- You can see what they've done To brothers of mine In one back-yard of Fifth Avenue. You can see what they've done To brothers of mine---- Sleepers on iron benches Behind the Library in Grant Park.
O, Great God of Cold and Winter, Wrap the earth about in an icy blanket And freeze the poor in their beds. All those who haven't enough cover To keep them warm, Nor food enough to keep them strong— Freeze, dear God. Let their limbs grow stiff And their hearts cease to beat, Then tomorrow They'll wake up in some rich kingdom of nowhere Where nothingness is everything and Everything is nothingness.
Shall I make a record of your beauty? Shall I write words about you? Shall make a poem that will live a thousand years and paint you in the poem? 
I am waiting for my mother. She is Death. Say it very softly. Say it very slowly if you choose. I am waiting for my mother, Death. 
Oh, the sea is deep And a knife is sharp And a poison acid burns; But they all bring rest In a deep, long sleep For which the tired soul yearns-- They all bring rest in a nothingness From where no road returns. 
I know you love me better, cold— Strange as the pyramids of old, Responselessly; But I am frail, am spent and weak With surging torrents that bespeak A living fire! So, like a veil, my poor disguise Is draped to save me from your eyes' Deep challenges. Fain would I fling this robe aside And from you, in your bosom hide Eternally! Alas! You love me better cold. Like frozen pyramids of old, Unyieldingly!
In your deep autumnal eyes Mystery's dark shadow lies, None may pass unchallenged there, Something vestal, Something rare Stays the plunging pagan tread-- One hesitates, One bows the head. 
I've learned of life this bitter truth: Hope not between the crumbling walls Of mankind's gratitude to find repose, But rather, Build within thy own soul Fortresses!
Lend me a candle by whose light I may discern the road Which winds into that magic path That leads to love's abode.
When I was young I used to say Romance will come riding by, And I shall surely smile And play with him a while. When I grew older then I said Romance may come riding by I wonder shall I smile And play with him a while? But now alas, I only say Romance came not riding by And I shall never smile, He has been dead the while!
Your voice keeps ringing down the day In accents soft and mild With which you have beguiled And wooed me as a child. Your presence bounds me every way And thrills me in its fold With phantom hands that hold Like cherished chains of gold.
What though no castles grand In somber grandeur stand Entitled with my name; What though uncrowned by fame I sing in humble state; I don't bemoan my fate: The April-haunted lea Is wealth enough for me.  
We are the Messenger, Our message brings you cheer ; Faint not, the goal's in sight, Your Victory is near. Our message brings you hope, The blue is in your skies, Take courage, Ethiopia's Sons, Your star is yet to rise. Our message brings you Joy, Forget the bitter sorrow Of Slavery's taint of yesterday, For Lo! There is-Tomorrow. Our message comes in answer To "Their" call of long ago, For Freedom and Intelligence, To down the wicked foe. Our message is your reaping, Oppression's sway must cease. Intelligence is our passport To Equal rights and peace. 
Why wait for tomorrow To shed sun shine on the way? Why wait to lighten sorrows, For the coming of a day? Why wait for a confessing, Of a wrong that you have done? Go and receive a blessing, 'Ere the setting of the sun. While Yesterday was once Today, For Joy, or for Sorrow; We do not know, we cannot say- To-day will be To-morrow!
He crouches strangely in the little bed And earnestly stares blankly into space, Reason forever more from him has fled, A child's mind settles sadly on his face.  The classic loveliness of plain white walls, The shadows softening the long, low ceiling, Against the low dull lights at evening fall, Impart to the sick room a holy feeling.  Maybe no hand once trembled with desire, Sheer love of form, to touch that ugly brow, But here disease-transformed, scourged by the fire,  Beauty the loftiest has touched it now.  
Ye sons of freedom, up, to battle! We go to war against the wrong; No longer we th' oppressor's cattle, We rise as men, ten million strong I We rise as men, ten million strong! Shall cowards kill and burn our mothers, Make bastard-orphans of the young, And then with threats bestill our tongue, While life is in our bodies, brothers?  Refrain: Up, up, ye men of bronze! Breathe now a freeman's breath! And claim your liberty in life Or freedom in your death!  With wealth and power the tryants fight us With laws and mobs and bolts and bars, But, up! let not these things affright us! We fight with God and with the stars ! We fight with God and with the stars ! Our pathway may be long and gory— Precious is freedom, high the price, Bought ever at a sacrifice— But at the end we gain the glory!  With ignorance they shall not bind us, We claim the freedom of the school ; With sophistries they shall not blind us, We will be men and no man's tool! We will be men and no man's tool! We ask not pity, O oppressor, Justice alone is our demand, The right to use our brain and hand, The right to be our soul's possessor!  We fight the fight of all the ages, And walk the path of all the just; We hear the voice of all the sages : We will be free if die we must! We will be free if die we must! No tyrant's torch or gun shall turn us, We fight for mothers, babes and wives, We die for these, our dearer lives, Though the oppressor shoot and burn us! O Freedom! let thy spirit charm us!  Let us not heed the coward's fear : The hand of death can never harm us, For freedom is than life more dear! For* freedom is than life more dear! Jehovah, God of all the races, Sustain our heart, accept our soul,— From everywhere to freedom's goal, Millions of Black Men, turn your faces!
My lonely heart and I, Waited for Spring, By the side of the road, And Spring passed by. We could not share her loveliness, The lilt of her song, blue sky, Exiled in our wilderness, My lonely heart and I.
From my safe place on the sands, I watched a lone canoe, Drifting helplessly in a bit; stream, With rocks and a waterfall, And I thought of someone I knew.
No forward soul, ambition stung, And sunk in carnal bliss, E'er dreamed a dream so fraught with heav'n And gave us verse like this. No lute attuned for flattery's ear, Or struck by greed for gain, E'er woke such cadences so sweet Or played so rare a straing. Not men, but Angels sing like this, Lit with celestial fire, And weep the strings with airy touch Of an immortal lyre. 
You lived and your body Clothed the flames of earth. Now that the fires have burned away And left your body cold, I tremble as I stand Before the chiseled marble Of your dust-freed soul. 
Oh the brown leaves    Fall in the bitter blast like tears From an aged widow. . . .  And whispering winds Steal the violets' breath And bury their leaves in snow. . . .  And the tides flow back Like the ebbing years Into cool immunity. But memory's voice, Like the music of waves, Sings April tunes     Forever. 
With satin skin and body bare, they beat the air with drum; They sang a weird, uncanny song that seemed to strike them numb; Full passionate their bodies beat to time not elsewhere heard— A melody of wind and rain and gentle song of bird.     When hawk and eagle fly by night,    There shines on each the same moon’s light.  With satin skin and body bare they danced to sun and star, They stalked the mighty game to lair, and drew men near and far; With milky skin and body decked a people came to see What made the satin bare-skinned men so happy and so free.     When hawk and eagle search by day,    They seek, forsooth, the self-same prey.  The simple truth they failed to see, it lay before their eyes: The men with satin skins were kings; they wore no motley dyes; They reached their goal on sweeping wings—such wings as eagles fly. The nightingale no longer sings when hawks go sailing by.     O eagle, spread your wings tonight;    Let not the hawk get out of sight.  The milky skins took bodies bare across the ocean wide; They made them slaves to their command, their souls they could not guide. All day the slaves worked in the sun, to till the soil their task, They suffered all that humans could and wore a smiling mask.     The eagle soars high in the air;    It holds a place no hawk will dare.  With nothing they could call their own, no earthly prize to win, Their hidden souls were theirs alone,—a holiness within; They held their heads as eagles do and looked into the sky. The hawks made circles in the air and with great pride flew by.     O hawk, fold up your wings tonight.    The eagle’s flown far from your sight.  Crusader, you of our own time, who proved to all the world That red and blue and white are strong when in ene emblem furled; Crusader, true, of our own time, who left a country fair, You turned a Son to your own clime—a Son with kingly air. For, radiant in your consciousness beneath your carriage bold, There shone your heritage of strength—a gift that eagles hold. 
A FANCY halts my feet at the way-side well. It is not to drink, for they say the water is brackish. It is not to tryst, for a heart at the mile's end beckons me on. It is not to rest, for what feet could be weary when a heart at the mile's end keeps time with their tread? It is not to muse, for the heart at the mile's end is food for my being. I will question the well for my secret by dropping a pebble into it. Ah, it is dry. Strike lightning to the road, my feet, for hearts are like wells. You may not know they are dry 'til you question their depths. Fancies clog the way to Heaven, and saints miss their crown.
This much the gods vouchsafe today:    That we two lie in the clover, Watching the heavens dip and sway,    With galleons sailing over. This much is granted for an hour:    That we are young and tender, That I am bee and you are flower,    Honey-mouthed and swaying slender. This sweet of sweets is ours now:    To wander through the land, Plucking an apple from its bough    To toss from hand to hand. No thing is certain, joy nor sorrow,    Except the hour we know it; Oh, wear my heart today; tomorrow    Who knows where the winds will blow it?
Along the shore the tall, thin grass    That fringes that dark river, While sinuously soft feet pass,    Begins to bleed and quiver.  The great dark voice breaks with a sob    Across the womb of night; Above your grave the tom-toms throb,    And the hills are weird with light.  The great dark heart is like a well    Drained bitter by the sky, And all the honeyed lies they tell    Come there to thirst and die.  No lie is strong enough to kill    The roots that work below; From your rich dust and slaughtered will    A tree with tongues will grow.
This is not water running here,    These thick rebellious streams That hurtle flesh and bone past fear    Down alleyways of dreams. This is a wine that must flow on    Not caring how nor where, So it has ways to flow upon    Where song is in the air. So it can woo an artful flute    With loose, elastic lips,  Its measurement of joy compute    With blithe, ecstatic hips.
Locked arm in arm they cross the way,    The black boy and the white, The golden splendor of the day,    The sable pride of night. From lowered blinds the dark folk stare,    And here the fair folk talk, Indignant that these two should dare    In unison to walk. Oblivious to look and word    They pass, and see no wonder That lightning brilliant as a sword    Should blaze the path of thunder.
With two white roses on her breasts,    White candles at head and feet, Dark Madonna of the grave she rests;    Lord Death has found her sweet. Her mother pawned her wedding ring    To lay her out in white; She'd be so proud she'd dance and sing    To see herself tonight.
Weep not, you who love her -- What rebellious flow Grief undams shall recover Whom the gods bid go? Sorrow rising like a wall, Bitter, blasphemous -- What avails it to recall Beauty back to us?  Think not this grave shall keep her, This marriage-bed confine; Death may dig it deep and deeper -- She shall climb it like a vine. Body that was quick and sentient, Dear as thought or speech, Death could not, with one trenchant Blow, snatch out of reach!  She is nearer than the word Wasted on her now, Nearer than the swaying bird On its rhythmic bough. Only were our faith as much As a mustard seed, Aching hungry hands might touch Her as they touch a reed.  Life, who was not loth to trade Her unto death, has done Better than he planned, has made Her wise as Solomon. Now she knows the Why and Wherefore, Troublous Whence and Whither; Why men strive and sweat, and care for Bays that droop and wither.  All the stars she knows by name, End and origin thereof, Knows if love be kin to shame, If shame be less than love. What was crooked now is straight, What was rough is plain; Grief and sorrow have no weight Now to cause her pain.  One to her are flame and frost; Silence is her singing lark. We alone are children -- lost, Crying in the dark. Varied features now, and form Change has bred upon her; Crush no bug or nauseous worm Lest you tread upon her.  Pluck no flower lest she scream; Bruise no slender reed Lest it prove more than it seem, Lest she groan and bleed. More than ever trust your brother, Read him golden, pure -- It may be she finds no other House so safe and sure.  Set no poet carving Rhymes to make her laugh; Only live hearts starving Need an epitaph. Lay upon her no white stone From a foreign quarry; Earth and sky, be these alone Her obituary.  Swift as a startled fawn or swallow, Silence all her sound, She has fled; we cannot follow Further than this mound. We who take the beaten track, Trying to appease Hearts near breaking with their lack, We need elegies. 
Now let all lovely things embark Upon the sea of mist With her whose luscious mouth the dark, Grim troubadour has kissed.  The silver clock that ticked away Her days, and never knew Its beats were sword thrusts to the clay That too much beauty slew.  The pillow favored with her tears And hallowed by her head; I shall not even keep my fears, Now their concern is dead.  But where shall I bury sun and rain, How mortalise the stars, How still the half-heard cries of pain That seared her soul with scars?  In what sea depths shall all the seeds Of every flower die? Where shall I scatter the broken reeds, And how erase the sky?  And where shall I find a hole so deep No troubled ghost may rise? There will I put my heart to sleep Wanting her face and eyes. 
I wake to the sound of a soft, low patter That comes like sudden news, Or like the slow, uncadenced clatter Of well-filled wooden shoes. I know I have not waked for long, That I shall dream again, that God has sent a slumber song Of dew and drowsy rain. I hear it rush the willows through, And strike the garden gate; Far off a love bird's plaintive coo Is answered of its mate. The night rain works a subtle charm Day showers never know; It make me burrow deep and warm Beneath my sheets of snow. It brims the pansy's eager cup, It dives to the oak's dank roots, Inquisitive, meanders up, And climbs the newest shoots. It drips a melancholy tune, As plunging fierce and deep, It scurries wild across the moon To steep my eyes in sleep. 
Four winds and seven seas have called me friend, And countless roads have known my restless feet; Deep crystal springs and pollened buds were sweet For sustenance their princely fare to lend, While nameless birds from grove and blossomed bend Deluged my soul with song; if it were meet To love Life so, then Love will but complete My joy, for Live with Love can never end. Love, I have heard the sweet of your voice, have seen  You pass the dawn-flushed singing hills between; Now suppliant I kneel and pray you show The mercied sceptre favored Esther saw; The dawn in my has broke, and well I know That Love is king and creed and Persian Law. 
If love be staunch, call mountains brittle; Love is a thing will live So long, my dear,—oh, just the little While water stays in a sieve.  Yea, love is deathless as the day Whose death the stars reveal; And love is loyal all the way, If treachery be leal.  Beyond the shadow of a doubt, No thing is sweet as love, But, oh, the bitterness spewed out Of the heart at the end thereof!  Beyond all cavil or complaint, Love’s ways are double-dyed; Beneath the surplice of a saint The cloven hooves are spied. Whom yesterday love rhymed his sun Today he names a star; When the course of another day is run, What will he say you are? 
My window opens out into the trees And in that small space Of branches and of sky I see the seasons pass Behold the tender green Give way to darker heavier leaves. The glory of the autumn comes When steeped in mellow sunlight The fragile, golden leaves Against a clear blue sky Linger in the magic of the afternoon And then reluctantly break off And filter down to pave A street with gold. Then bare, gray branches Lift themselves against the Cold December sky Sometimes weaving a web Across the rose and dusk of late sunset Sometimes against a frail new moon And one bright star riding A sky of that dark, living blue Which comes before the heaviness Of night descends, or the stars Have powdered the heavens. Winds beat against these trees; The cold, but gentle rain of spring Touches them lightly The summer torrents strive To lash them into a fury And seek to break them- But they stand. My life is fevered And a restlessness at times An agony—again a vague And baffling discontent Possesses me. I am thankful for my bit of sky And trees, and for the shifting Pageant of the seasons. Such beauty lays upon the heart A quiet. Such eternal change and permanence Take meaning from all turmoil And leave serenity Which knows no pain.
The sky was blue, so blue, that day, And each daisy white, so white; Oh! I knew that no more could rains fall gray, And night again be night. I knew! I knew! Well, if night is night, And the gray skies grayly cry, I have in a book, for the candle light, A daisy, dead and dry.
When the lights blur out for thee and me, And the black comes in with a sweep, I wonder--will it mean life again, Or sleep? 
Second prize poem in the Amy Spingarn Contest. Dr. Horne was born in New York City in 1899. He was educated at the College of the City of New York, the University of Chicago and the Northern Illinois College of Opthalmology. He is a practising optometrist in New York City.  * * * To All of You  My little stone Sinks quickly Into the bosom of this deep, dark pool Of oblivion... I have troubled its breast but little. Yet those far shores That knew me not Will feel the fleeting, furtive kiss Of my tiny concentric ripples....   To Lewellyn  You have borne full well The burden of my friendship— I have drunk deep At your crystal pool, And in return I have-polluted its waters With the bile of my hatred, I have flooded your soul With tortuous thoughts, I have played Iscariot To your Pythias...   To Mother   I came In the blinding sweep Of ecstatic pain, I go In the throbbing pulse Of Aching Space, In the eons between I piled upon you Pain on pain Ache on ache And yet as I go I shall know That you will grieve And want me back.....   To Bennetti   You have freed me— In opening wide the doors Of fiesh— You have freed me Of the binding leash. I have climbed the heights Of white disaster. My body screaming In the silver crash of passion..... Before you gave yourself To him I had chained myself For you. But when at last You lowered your proud flag In surrender complete You gave me too, as hostage— And I have swept my joy At the dawn-tipped shrine Of many breasts.   To Jean  When you poured your love Like molten flame Into the throbbing mold Of her pulsing veins Leaving her blood a river of fire And her arteries channels of light, I hated you...  Hated with that primal hate That has its wells In the flesh of me And the flesh of you And the flesh of her I hated you— Hated with envy Your mastery of her being. . With one fleshy gesture You pricked the irridescent bubble Of my dreams And so to make Your conquest more sweet I tell you now That I hated you...  To Catalina  Love thy piano,Oh girl, It will give you back Note for Note The harmonies of your soul. It will sing back to you The high songs of your heart. It will give As well as take.  To Mariette  I sought ccnsolation In the sorrow of your eyes. You sought reguerdon In the crying of my heart. . We found that shattered dreamers Can be bitter hosts....   To ————   You call it Death of the Spirit And I call it Life... The vigor of vibration, The muffled knocks, The silver sheen of passion’s flood, The ecstacy of pain.. You call it Death of the Spirit And I call it Life.  To Telie  You have made my voice A rippling laugh But my heart A crying thing . ’Tis better thus, A fleeting kiss And then, The dark  To “Chick”  Oh Achilles of the moleskins And the gridiron Do not wonder Nor doubt that this is I That lie so calmly here— This is the same exultant beast That so joyously Ran the ball with you In those far flung days of abandon. You remember how récklessly We revelled in the heat and the dust And the swirl of conflict? You remember they called us The Terrible Two? And you remember After we had battered our heads And our bodies Against the stonewall of their defense,— You remember the signal I would call And how you would look at me In faith and admiration And say “Let’s go”... How the lines would clash And strain, And how I would find an opening, A wee small space, Amidst tangling arms and torsos, And how I would slip through Fighting and squirming Over the line To victory. You remember, Chick? When you gaze at me here Let that same light Of faith and admiration Shine in your eyes For I have battered the stark stonewall Before me.  I have kept faith with you And now I have called my signal, Found my opening And slipped through Fighting and squirming Over the line To victory.  To Wanda  To you, so far away So cold and aloof, - To you, who knew me so well, This is my last Grand Gesture This my last Great Effect And as I go winging Through the black doors of eternity Is that thin sound I hear Your applause? .....  
It’s an earth song,— And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song. It’s a spring song,— And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.    Strong as the shoots of a new plant    Strong as the bursting of new buds    Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s womb. It’s an earth song, A body-song, A spring song, I have been waiting long for this spring song.
Being walkers with the dawn and morning Walkers with the sun and morning, We are not afraid of night, Nor days of gloom, Nor darkness, Being walkers with the sun and morning.
I, too, sing America.  I am the darker brother. They send me to eat in the kitchen When company comes, But I laugh, And eat well,  And grow strong.  Tomorrow,  I'll sit at the table When company comes. Nobody'll dare Say to me, 'Eat in the kitchen,' then.   Besides, They'll see how beautiful I am And be ashamed,--  I, too, am America. 
We have to-morrow Bright before us Like a flame  Yesterday, a night-gone thing A sun-down name And dawn to-day  Broad arch above the road we came, We march!
My old man's a white old man And my old mother's black. If ever I cursed my white old man I take my curses back.  If ever I cursed my black old mother And wished she were in hell, I'm sorry for that evil wish And now I wish her well.  My old man died in a fine big house. My ma died in a shack. I wonder where I'm gonna die, Being neither white nor black? 
Bring me all of your dreams, You dreamers. Bring me all of your Heart melodies That I may wrap them In a blue cloud-cloth Away from the too rough fingers Of the world.
Sea charm The sea's own children Do not understand. They know But that the sea is strong Like God's hand. They know But that sea wind is sweet Like God's breath, And that the sea holds A wide, deep death.
The sounds Of the Harlem night Drop one by one into stillness. The last player -piano is closed. The last victrola ceases with the "Jazz Boy Blues.” The last crying baby sleeps And the night becomes Still as a whispering heartbeat. I toss Without rest in the darkness, Weary as the tired night, My soul Empty as the silence, Empty with a vague, Aching emptiness, Desiring, Needing someone, Something.  I toss without rest In the darkness Until the new dawn, Wan and pale, Descends like a white mist Into the court-yard. 
I would be simple again, Simple and clean Like the earth, Like the rain, Nor ever know, Dark Harlem, The wild laughter Of your mirth Nor the salt tears Of your pain. Be kind to me, Oh, great dark city. Let me forget. I will not come To you again. 
They say she died,-- Although I do not know, They say she died of grief And in the earth-dark arms of Death Sought calm relief, And rest from pain of love In loveless sleep. 
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune, Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,    I heard a Negro play. Down on Lenox Avenue the other night By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light    He did a lazy sway. . . .     He did a lazy sway. . . .  To the tune o' those Weary Blues. With his ebony hands on each ivory key He made that poor piano moan with melody.    O Blues! Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.    Sweet Blues! Coming from a black man's soul.    O Blues! In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan    "Ain't got nobody in all this world,    Ain't got nobody but ma self.    I's gwine to quit ma frownin'    And put ma troubles on the shelf.” Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor. He played a few chords then he sang some more    "I got the Weary Blues    And I can't be satisfied.    Got the Weary Blues    And can't be satisfied    I ain't happy no mo'    And I wish that I had died.”       And far into the night he crooned that tune.       The stars went out and so did the moon.       The singer stopped playing and went to bed       While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.       He slept like a rock or a man that's dead.
The mills  That grind and grind, That grind out new steel And grind away the lives  Of men,-- In the sunset Their stacks Are great black silhouettes Againset the sky. In the dawn They belch red fire. The mills,-- Grinding out new steel, Old men.
You are no friend of mine For I am poor, Black, Ignorant and slow,-- Not your kind, You yourself Have told me so,-- No friend of mine.
Because my mouth  Is wide with laughter And my throat Is deep with song, You do not think  I suffer after  I have held my pain  So long.   Because my mouth  Is wide with laughter,  You do not hear My inner cry,  Because my feet  Are gay with dancing,  You do not know  I die.  
I loved my friend. He went away from me. There's nothing more to say. The poem ends, Soft as it began, I loved my friend. 
She stands  In the quiet darkness, This troubled woman, Bowed by  Weariness and pain, Like an  Autumn flower In the frozen rain. Like a Wind-blown autumn flower That never lifts its head Again. 
A wild poppy-flower Withered and died.  The day-people laughed— But the night-people cried.  A wild poppy-flower Withered and died. 
No, never quite alone am I. Of Ill why should I borrow? No matter where my footsteps bend There also follows sorrow.  And she has taught my lips to sing A rapt and dauntless measure While all the world goes envying My mellow noted treasure.  No, I have never walked alone! And as I face tomorrow, If I am bereft of joy I know there will be sorrow.  
In the silence and the dark I fought with dragons; I was battered, beaten, sore,  But rose again. On my knees I fought still rising, Dull with pain!  In the dark I fought with dragons-- Foolish tears! Cease your flowing! Can't you see the dawn appears? 
Sorrow, sorrow, Hug me round So that I shall not be found By sorrow; She pursues me Everywhere, I can't lose her Anywhere.  Fold me in your black Abyss. She will never look  In this,-- Shadows, shadows, Hug me round In your solitude  Profound.  Pubsliehd in The Crisis, May 1925
Slim Sentinels Stretching lacy arms  About a slumbrous moon; Black quivering Silhouettes Tremulous, Stencilled on the petal Of a bluebell; Ink spluttered On a robin's breast' The jagged rent Of mountains  Reflected in a  Stilly sleeping lake; Fragile pinnacles Of fairy castles; Torn webs of shadows; And  Printed 'gainst the sky-- The trembling beauty Of an urgent pine. 
Last night you lost the rarest thing Life ever gave to you. It was a friendship that was deep, Unvarying and true. I'm sorry that you have it not Because you need it so; When one has killed the flower's root How can it ever grow? 
Promise  If you can laught along the road, Altho you bend beneath a load    Of sorrow, Your hope-lit eyes shall surely see A rainbow sweep eternity    Tomorrow. Prejudice The World is dark, I cannot see my way! Eternal clouds Obscure the light of day-- I seek a break, a rift, a litttle space, There to behold One God-illumined place! 
You deck my doby lavishly, I'm sleek and overfed; And yet my soul is perishing, Denied of daily bread. You make a plaything of my life, My every trust betray, And when I would be penitent, You kiss my prayers away. 
The Pullman porters need a raise, Yes, siree! These men behind it deserve praise, Take it from me, Everyone should fall in line, Boost the movement, Yell it's fine! More money for them Pullman boys All along the line. They scare make a living wage As things stand. A raise, regardless of the age We now demand. These are a loyal bunch of men, They serve us all now and then, So yell, 'More pay,' Yell it again For the Pullman men.
Down at the feet of the years we shall find them All of the dear vanished things, All of the dreamings that never came true, All that 'might have been' for me and for you.  Find our dead flowers fragrant with dew, Growing by life-giving springs.  Down at the feet of the years we shall find them Tenderly hidden away, Wee little laddies that never were men, Wee little lassies that never knew sin.  Down at the feet of the years we shall find them Jewels that once were our tears. Find all our losses were infinite gain,  Mysteries too deep for our dull, human ken, Kept for a happier day.  Find perfect joy that we once thought was pain. Praise in abundance that once seemed as blame, Down at the feet of the years.  
Far down, down through the city’s great, gaunt gut The gray train rushing bears the weary wind; In the packed cars the fans the crowd’s breath cut, Leaving the sick and heavy air behind. And pale-cheeked children seek the upper door To give their summer jackets to the breeze; Their laugh is swallowed in the deafening roar Of captive wind that moans for fields and seas; Seas cooling warm where native schooners drift Through sleepy waters, while gulls wheel and sweep, Waiting for windy waves the keels to lift Lightly among the islands of the deep; Islands of lofty palm trees blooming white That lend their perfume to the tropic sea, Where fields lie idle in the dew drenched night, And the Trades float above them fresh and free.
Your door is shut against my tightened face, And I am sharp as steel with discontent; But I possess the courage and the grace To bear my anger proudly and unbent. The pavement slabs burn loose beneath my feet, A chafing savage, down the decent street, And passion rends my vitals as I pass, Where boldly shines your shuttered door of glass. Oh I must search for wisdom every hour, Deep in my wrathful bosom sore and raw, And find in it the superhuman power To hold me to the letter of your law! Oh I must keep my heart inviolate Against the potent poison of your hate.
Like a strong tree that in the virgin earth Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay, And proudly thrives in rain or time of dearth, When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away; Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep, For sunken water, fluid underground, Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep, And queer things of the nether world abound: So would I live in rich imperial growth, Touching the surface and the depth of things, Instinctively responsive unto both, Tasting the sweets of being and the stings, Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms, Like a strong tree against a thousand storms.
Bananas ripe and green, and ginger-root, Cocoa in pods and alligator pears, And tangerines and mangoes and grape fruit, Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs, Set in the window, bringing memories Of fruit-trees laden by low-singing rills, And dewy dawns, and mystical blue skies In benediction over nun-like hills. My eyes grew dim, and I could no more gaze; A wave of longing through my body swept, And, hungry for the old, familiar ways, I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.
O Autumn, Autumn! O pensive light and wistful sound! Cold haunted sky, green-haunted ground!  When, wan, the dead leaves flutter by Deserted realms of butterfly! When robins band themselves together  To seek the soul of sun-steeped weather; And all of summer's largesse goes For lands of olive and the rose!  
The moon Was an old, old woman, tonight, Hurrying home; Calling pitifully to her children, The stars, Begging them to go home with her For she was afraid, But they would not. They only laughed While she crept along Huddling against the dark blue wall of the Night Stooping low, Her old black hood wrapped close about her ears, And only the pale curve of her yellow cheek With a tear in the hollow of it Showing through. And the wind laughed too, For he was teasing the old woman, Pelting her with snowballs, Filling her old eyes with the flakes of them, Making her cold. She stumbled along, shivering, And once she fell, And the snow buried her; And all her jewels Slid from the old bag Under her arm And fell to earth, And the tall trees seized them, And hung them about their necks, And filled their bony arms with them. All their nakedness was covered by her jewel ‘And they would not give them back to her. The old moon-woman moaned piteously, Hurrying home; And the wild wind laughed at her And her children laughed too, And the tall trees taunted her With their glittering plunder.
Mr. John, listen to me: Don't pull any foolish stunt. And don't make another move. Just keep your hand closed up tight. Nothing you think of doing Can ever make me afraid — Fear died in me long ago. You may live in the Big House And own all the land in sight: But you can't get me, unless, You come across as I bid. And hear all I have to say. You and I are related — You don't like that do you? Well, its true, nevertheless. It doesn't matter to me. Now that I see things clearly. Great-grandmother, a victim With all the rest of her tribe. Paying the price of slavery Down thru the generations. Wasn't I just a love-child. Killing my mother at birth? Then grandmother did washings To send me to school to learn. To learn that I have freedom And I belong to myself! Now, you're standing there begging. Willing to eat from my hand: Before, you offered a coin. Thinking I'd jump at the chance. Some poor devils would, maybe. Black-white-red-vellow or brown. Skin doesn't matter, really. When a man gets excited. I know you, you White-Blackguard! You low "Yaller Gal" Coward! You're wild about my color. I can see it in your eyes. You've forgotten your woman. Alone there in the Big House — A wife has a thankless part— Why, she'll love vou for nothing. And be happy at the tho't. But no, you are'nt satisfied. You want everything you see : And sometimes you crave blindly For the very soul of me. When you were a little boy They whipped you on mv account : I wept my aching heart out While you bore it like a man And came bringing me candy As soon as you stole away. Now, you're grown up and vou come With that pitiful "two-bits" — Thinking I'll fall, you cheap-skate! Well, you've got me dead wrong, see? Oh, I'm for sale allright, sure : But its at my price, not yours. I'll not give myself away. I'll sell you my stock in trade— Its the oldest in the world. You can buy me, yes indeed. Only let me tell vou this: Man, you've got to have dollars With that quarter to get mel
I felt the lure of the city, With the grey-green lake at its feet-- The strong breezes sweeping across it-- The eddying crowds in its streets! I felt the clasp of your fingers, Comforting, warm and near; But I did not turn on my pillow-- For I knew you would not be here! For the urge of the far-away city, And the face that I would not see- Were there in your vibrant summons, 'Come back to Chicago--and me!'
It is Saturday night. The place is crowded And such a crowd! It is neither black nor white, Brown nor yellow There are all colors, There are all manners of peopleI Here and there, you may catch Blue-tinted by the smoke A glimpse of an oriental face The lights of the place are as manv-hued As the faces of the people Wine and Whiskey are poured like oil Into the fire of Youth, Causing leaping, ambitious flames Giving added brightness to maiden eves Which seem to say, "There is fire within, Beware!" - Old men and women are here, too Their glimmering coals are fanned to heat anew Soul endangering, Which consume their dry old carcasses. There comes a whirl of noise Like the breaking of a storm. There is a hint of harmony-- A bit of melody. Five men, black, brown and yellow Contortionists of notes, instruments And bodies, make music. At once, there is wild motion! Motion that defies description Each couple improvising movements. Those most inflamed by wine, music Or close embraces, Surpass their fellows. My eyes follow couple after couple. There is a brown girl, a wild thing, Graceful as rippling silk, With eyes that laugh over the shoulders of a Bold boy Whose ancestors might have been Vikings, So big and strong is he. They whirl on and I lose them in the crowd, Only to be attracted by a Chinese lad Dancing gaily with a maiden of the Occident. He holds her closely-- His face expressionless. The girl is smiling No, she is Iaughing! He whispers something with a swift side-wise glance. She tosses back her pretty head And laughs and laughs and laughs! A little brown haired girl With a Lothario long withered Who would cheat Time with such a play-mate Flirts boldly with a brown youngster. Who has the look of neither toiling Nor spinning, He is good-looking, I think Yet, too smooth-looking, too finished in His knife-creased clothes. He hints of marked cards--bounty paving women-- Yet-Satyrs grown gross pouched and bald Are damn poor jazzing mates! A bell clangs! One o'clock! I join the struggle for the door And reach the open air And a pert cabman!
Lady, Lady, I saw your face, Dark as night withholding a star . . . The chisel fell, or it might have been You had borne so long the yoke of men. Lady, Lady, I saw your hands, Twisted, awry, like crumpled roots, Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub, Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub. Lady, Lady, I saw your heart, And altared there in its darksome place Were the tongues of flame the ancients knew, Where the good God sits to spangle through.
America I sing to you A hymn of love mixed with my tears, A hymn made up of thoughts that spring From many, many cruel years. I love you my America Who would not want to call me yours ; With all the wrongs that hemmed me in I stood up to defend your doors. Before I knew time, place, or scene, My mother kept before my view Your emblem lighted with the stars, Which I still saw there as I grew. And when I saw out in the bay Shining above all other glare The light that burns throughout the night, I smiled and said I need not fear. I thought it then a light to love, To liberty and every good ; But that was false — a light to hell I found it soon after I stood Upon the hill where Life took me To view the things that are as rare, To feel the teeth of poverty And pull at opportunity's bar. I had high hopes, bright dreams were mine, A future roseate as the light That limns the shadows of the hills Against the sky as dawn grows bright. Too soon hate's dark eclipse hid all The brightness of this day of hope; And your weak pride narrowed and bound My every effort, every scope. But still America I lived Scourged by the jeers, the taunts, the scorn ; Why should some men inherit love And some to such strong hate be born ? America I pay with love For all the hate you give to me; I take your jagged-edge cup and drink The drug of dark hate fearlessly. I know it can but drug the sense. And hold ambition to the earth ; For hate can never conquer me, Nor wrong rob me of all my mirth. I shall still cry, shall laugh and play Until some larger heart should come To light yours into flames of love That burn for all and not for some. And still a dream is in my soul In which I see you handing me A golden star of membership In this great world's fraternity. Then from the ruins of much wrong, Within the shining shop of right I'll forge for you a tower wherefrom Shall gleam earth's purest brightest light. Then all the nations of this world Shall look to you and call you great ; Because your light shall shine afar When one large love replaces hate. 
Avenues of dreams Boulevards of pain Moving black streams Shimmering like rain.
O apple blossoms Give me your words of silence, Yes, your charming speech. Why sit like the sphinx, Watching the caravan pass? Join in the parade. What if the wind blows? What if the leaves are scattered, Now that they are dead? This is but my robe, His Majesty gave to me. Garments will decay.
Walk with the sun. Dance at high noon; And dream when night falls black; But when the stars Vie with the moon. Then call the lost dream back. 
I shall hate you  Like a dart of singing steel Shot through still air At even-tide. Or solemnly As pines are sobre When they stand etched Against the sky. Hating you shall be a game Played with cool hands And slim fingers. Your heart will yearn For the lonely splendour Of the pine tree; While rekindled fires  In my eyes Shall wound you like swift arrows. Memory will lay its hands Upon your breast And you will understand My hatred. 
Cemeteries are places for departed souls And bones interred, Or hearts with shattered loves. A woman with lips made warm for laughter Would find grey stones and roving spirits Too chill for living, moving pulses . . . And thou, great spirit, wouldst shiver in thy granite shroud Should idle mirth or empty talk Disturb thy tranquil sleeping. A cemetery is a place for shattered loves And broken hearts . . . Bowed before the crystal chalice of thy soul, I find the multi-colored fragrance of thy mind Has lost itself in Death's transparency. Oh, stir the lucid waters of thy sleep And coin for me a tale Of happy loves and gems and joyous limbs And hearts where love is sweet! A cemetery is a place for broken hearts And silent thought . . . And silence never moves, nor speaks, Nor sings.
Night wears a garment, All velvet soft, all violet blue . . .  And over her face she draws a veil As shimmering fine as floating dew . . .  And here and there In the black of her hair, The subtle hands of Night Move slowly with their gem-starred light. 
Oh, my sweet, I shall paint you a picture And call it spring Cool greens and sheep Upon a smoke-blue hill, And now and then A puff of snow-white cloud. I shall write you a poem And call it spring, too— A poem of soft, warm words With little shocks of bright delight ... Deep in the center Of my inmost self There sleeps a song— A laughing tune Of trills and rhymes..... The hidden song is such a silly thing, But I shall name it—very softly—SPRING!
Some things are very dear to me— Such things as flowers bathed by rain Or patterns traced upon the sea. Or crocuses where snow has lain.... The iridescence of a gem. The moon's cool, opalescent light, Azaleas and the scent of thetn, And honeysuckles in the night. And many sounds are also dear— Like winds that sing among the trees. Or crickets calling from the weir. Or Negroes humming melodies. But dearer far than all surmise Are sudden tear-drops in your eyes. 
Bury the love you bore for me Deep beneath your laughing songs. Cover it well with melody; Let it lie where its ghost belongs. Laughter was what you had given me. That and joyous songs to rue. Cover your love with melody, For so it thrived and grew.
A TREE is more than a shadow Blurred against the sky, More than ink spilled on the fringe Of white clouds floating by. A tree is more than an April design Or a blighted winter bough Where love and music used to be. A tree is something in me, Very still and lonely now.
Then the golden hour Will tick its last And the flame will go down in the flower. A briefer length of moon Will mark the sea-line and the yellow dune. Then we may think of this, yet There will be something forgotten And something we should forget. It will be like all things we know : A stone will fail; a rose is sure to go. It will be quiet then and we may stay Long at the picket gate, But there will be less to say.
Here indeed is the rising surf, The sea you told me of: A singing wind, A sailing moon, And the long, cool wash of wave. And the breath of the storm-cloud: Darkness And the far, mysterious call Of lonely gulls. But all the simple sialor men Who knew you in that day, Tell me, Captain, Where, indeed, are they? 
We are not come to wage a strife With swords upon this hill, It is not wise to waste the life Against a stubborn will. Yet would we die as some have done: Beating a way for the rising sun. 
The pitcher, Struck by a careless hand, Is broken at the fountain. The stone that was so sure Is cracked at last By the dip of Spring; And the song, Once eagerly proclaimed, Grown mute in me At last. 
Where now is the blaze that hung intense       Through summer days? Transmuted into another sense       By slanting rays? Is it your keel, O Earth, with a turn sublime        Which changes Time And makes the sunshine weary and mellow And the flowers wither, and green leaves yellow? And man, is he a flower—or a green leaf       Whose flourish is brief? Old Earth, sailing so even and quiet.       Stilling the riot In the blood of youth, is yours the blame?—       Or does Time play your game? Are you one. or twain, that makes autumn weather In the body of man, or do you work in the sere together?
There was a man —Whose name was Pete, And he was a buck —From his head to his feet. He loved a dollar, —But hated a dime; And so was poor —Nine-tenths of the time. The Judge said “Pete, —What of your wife?” And Pete replied —“She lost her life.” “Pete,” said the Judge, —“Was it lost in a row? Tell me quick, —And tell me how.” Pete straightened up —With a hic and a sigh, Then looked the Judge —Full in the eye. “O, Judge, my wife —Would never go To a Sunday dance —Or a movie show. “But I went, Judge, —Both day and night, And came home broke —And also tight. “The moon was up, —My purse was down, And I was the bully —Of the bootleg town. “I was crooning a lilt —To corn and rye For the loop in my legs —And the fight in my eye. “I met my wife; —She was wearing a frown, And catechising —Her Sunday gown. “ ‘O Pete, O Pete’ —She cried aloud, ‘The Devil is falling —Right out of a cloud.’ “I looked straight up —And fell flat down And a Ford machine —Pinned my head to the ground. “The Ford moved on, —And my wife was in it; And I was sober, —That very minute. “For my head was bleeding, —My heart was a-flutter; And the moonshine within me —Was tipping the gutter. “The Ford, it faster —And faster sped Till it dipped and swerved —And my wife was dead. “Two bruised men lay —In a hospital ward— One seeking vengeance, —The other the Lord. “He said to me: —‘Your wife was drunk, You are crazy, —And my Ford is junk.’ “I raised my knife —And drove it in At the top of his head —And the point of his chin. “O Judge, O Judge, —If the State has a chair, Please bind me in it —And roast me there.” There was a man —Whose name was Pete, And he welcomed death —From his head to his feet.
YOU too listless to examine If in pestilence or famine Death lurk least, a hungry gamin Gnawing on you like a beaver On a root, while you trifle Time away nodding in the sun, Careless how the shadows crawl Surely up your crumbling wall, Heedless of the Thief’s footfall, Death’s whose nimble fingers rifle Your heartbeats one by weary one,— Here’s the difference in our dying: You go dawdling, we go flying. Here’s a thought flung out to plague you: Ours the pleasure if we’d liever Burn completely with the fever Than go ambling with the ague.
They in their cruel traps, and we in ours,    Survey each other’s rage, and pass the hours    Commiserating each the other’s woe,    To mitigate his own pain’s fiery glow.    Man could but little proffer in exchange    Save that his cages have a larger range.    That lion with his lordly, untamed heart    Has in some man his human counterpart, Some lofty soul in dreams and visions wrapped,    But in the stifling flesh securely trapped.    Gaunt eagle whose raw pinions stain the bars    That prison you, so men cry for the stars! Some delve down like the mole far underground,    (Their nature is to burrow, not to bound), Some, like the snake, with changeless slothful eye,    Stir not, but sleep and smoulder where they lie.     Who is most wretched, these caged ones, or we,    Caught in a vastness beyond our sight to see?
If for a day joy masters me,    Think not my wounds are healed; Far deeper than the scars you see    I keep their roots concealed. They shall bear blossoms with the fall;    I have their word for this  Who tend my roots with rains of gall,    And suns of prejudice.
We shall not always plant while others reap The golden increment of bursting fruit, Nor always countenance, abject and mute, That lesser men should hold their brothers cheap ; Not everlastingly while others sleep Shall we beguile their limbs with mellow flute, Not always bend to some more subtle brute; We were not made eternally to weep. The night whose sable breast relieves the stark, White stars is no less lovely being dark, And there are buds that cannot bloom at all In light, but crumple, piteous, and fall. So in the dark we hide the heart that bleeds, And wait, and tend our agonizing seeds.
I WISH your body were in the grave, Deep down as a grave may be, Or rotting under the deepest wave That ever ploughed the sea. I wish I never had seen your face, Or the sinuous curve of your mouth, Dear as a straw to a man who drowns Or rain to a land in drouth. I would that your mother had never borne, Your father’s seed to fruit, That meadow rats had gnawed his corn Before it gathered root.
All the time they were praying He watched the shadow of a tree Flicker on the wall. There is no need of prayer, He said, No need at all. The kin-folk thought it strange That he should ask them from a dying bed. But they left all in a row And it seemed to ease him To see them go. There were some who kept on praying In a room across the hall And some who listened to the breeze That made the shadows waver On the wall. He tried his nerve On a song he knew And made an empty note That might have come, From a bird's harsh throat. And all the time it worried him That they were in there praying And all the time he wondered What it was they could be saying.
When I am in my grrave And none are there Save those who like myself Must sleep, I shall wake at times To weep. I shall wake at times To weep, For I need have no fears There That someone see My tears. I need have no fears.
So detached and cool she is No motion e'er betrays The secret life within her soul, The anguish of her days. She seems to look upon the world With cold ironic eyes, To spurn emotion's fevered sway, To scoff at tears and sighs. But once a woman with a child Passed by her on the street, And once she heard from casual lips A man's name, bitter-sweet. Such baffled yearning in her eyes, Such pain upon her face! I turned aside until the mask Was slipped once more in place.
I doom, I live, I will, I take, I lie, I kill! I rend and rear In deserts drear I build and burrow well. With wrack and rue I hound and hue On founding stones in hell; My temples rise And split the skies. My winged wheels do tell The woven wonders of my hand. The witch-work of my skill! I writhe, I rave. To chain the slave I do the deed, I kill! Now what care I For God or Lie? I am the great       I WILL. 
O Star-kissed drifting from above. On misty moonbeams, sunshine shod, Dim daughter of the lips of God, To me and angels—Thou art Love! O Earth-dipped raining joy, and rife With all still wonders that abide, Ghost Mother to the Time and Tide, To me and faery—Thou art Life. In love and life, in wrack and ruth A whisper on the road to hell. High heaven's herald, ringing well Dear Death's destruction—Thou art Truth.
How did it happen that we quarreled? We two who loved each other so! Only the moment before we were one, Using the language that lovers know. And then of a sudden, a word, a phrase That struck at the heart like a poignard’s blow. And you went beserk, and I saw red, And love lay between us, bleeding and dead! Dead! When we loved each other so! How could it happen that we quarreled! Think of the things we used to say! “What does it matter, dear, what you do? Love such as ours has to last for aye!” —“Try me! I love to ensure your test!” —“Love, we shall always love, come what may!” What are the words the apostle saith? “In the power of the tongue are Life and Death!” Think of the things we used to say!
If this is peace, this dead and leaden thing, Then better far the hateful fret, the sting, Better the wound forever seeking balm Than this gray calm! Is this pain's surcease? Better far the ache, The long-drawn dreary day, the night's white wake; Better the choking sigh, the sobbing breath Than passion's death! 
I would they were .... a Pegasus herd, And I could whip them Flying .... up the crest of Parnassus With great wings outspread and all a’shine In the morning sun. . But instead .... they trudge and crawl Like any plow horse-- A sluggish pack ....their broad backs wet And steaming In their labor. Their pace is so slow In the morning sun. . . .  
I buried you deeper last night, You with your tears And your tangled hair You with your lips That kissed so fair I buried you deeper last night, I buried you deeper last night, With fuller breasts And stronger arms With softer lips And newer charms I buried you deeper last night. Deeper .... aye, deeper And again tonight 'Till that gay spirit That once was you Will tear its soul In climbing through Deeper .... aye, deeper I buried you deeper last night.
I went to look for Joy, Slim, dancing Joy, Gay, laughing Joy, Bright-eyed Joy,---- And I found her Driving the butcher's cart In the arms of the butcher boy! Such company, such company, As keeps this young nymph, Joy! 
Strut and wiggle, Shameless gal. Wouldn't no good fellow Be your pal. Hear dat music. . . . Jungle night. Hear dat music. . . . And the moon was white. Sing your Blues song, Pretty baby. You want lovin' And you don't mean maybe. Jungle lover. . . . Night black boy. . . .  Two against the moon And the moon was joy. Strut and wiggle, Shameless Nan. Wouldn't no good fellow Be your man?
I got a job now Runnin an elevator In the Dennison Hotel in Jersey, Job aint no good though. No money around.    Jobs are just chances    Like everything else.    Maybe a little luck now,    Maybe not.    Maybe a good job sometimes:    Step out o' the barrel, boy. Two new suits an' A woman to sleep with.    Maybe no luck for a long time.    Only the elevators    Goin' up an' down,    Up an' down,    Or somebody else's shoes    To shine,    Or greasy pots in a dirty kitchen. I been runnin' this Elevator too long. Guess I'll quit now.
Dusk dark On Railroad Avenue. Lights in the fish joints, Lights in the pool rooms. A box car some train Has forgotten In the middle of the block. A player piano, A victrola .    942    Was the number. A boy Lounging on the corner. A passing girl With purple powdered skin.    Laughter    Suddenly    Like a taut drum.    Laughter    Suddenly    Neither truth nor lie.    Laughter Hardening the dusk dark evening.    Laughter Shaking the lights in the fish joints, Rolling white balls in the pool rooms, And leaving untouched the box car Some train has forgotten.
Ideals are like the stars, Always above our reach. Humbly I tried to learn, More humbly did I teach. On all honest virtues I sought to keep firm hold. I wanted to be a good man Though I pinched my soul. But now I lie beneath cool loam Forgetting every dream; And in this narrow bed of earth No lights gleam. In this narrow bed of earth Star-dust never scatters, And I tremble lest the darkness teach Me that nothing matters.
Love Is a ripe plum Growing on a purple tree. Taste it once And the spell of its enchantment Will never let you be. Love Is a bright star Glowing in far Southern skies. Look too hard And its burning flame Will always hurt your eyes. Love Is a high mountain Stark in a windy sky. If you Would never lose your breath Do not climb too high.
Singing black boatmen An August morning In the thick white fog at Sekondi Coming out to take Cargo From anchored alien ships. You do not know the fog We strange so-civilized ones Sail in always. 
Shall I tell you of my old, old dreams Lost at the earth's strange turnings, Some in the sea when the waves foamed high. Some in a garret candle's burnings? Shall I tell you of bitter, forgotten dreams— You who are still so young, so young? You with your wide brown singing eyes And laughter at the tip of your tongue. Shall I tell you of weary, weary dreams,— You who have lost no dreams at all, Or shall I keep quiet and let turn My ugly pictures to the wall?
Love is the master of the ring And life a circus tent. What is this silly song you sing? Love is the master of the ring.  I am afraid! Afraid of Love And of love’s bitter whip! Afraid, Afraid of Love And Love’s sharp, stinging whip.  What is this silly song you sing? Love is the master of the ring. 
To worship At the altar of Beauty, To feel her loveliness and pain, To thrill At the wonder of her gorgeous moon Or the sharp, swift, silver swords Of falling rain.  To walk in a golden garden When an autumn sun Has almost set, When near-night’s purple splendor Shimmers to a star-shine net.  To worship At the altar of Beauty Is a pleasure divine, Not given to the many many But to fools Who drink Beauty’s wine. Not given to the many many But to fools Who seek no other goddess Nor grapes Plucked from another’s Vine. 
Just a bit of ashes Grey, grey ashes--spent-- God! how fierce the fires burned Down to this content. Just a bit of ashes, Not a single spark Lives in this residuum Crumbling cold and dark. Just a bit of ashes-- To the judgment day, I go with my memories-- Pray, sweet vrigin, pray! 
The hour is big with sooth and sign, with errant men at war, While blood of alien, friend, and foe imbues the land afar, And we, with sable faces pent, move with the vanguard line. Shod with a faith that Springtime keeps, and all the stars opine.
To climb a hill that hungers for the sky, To dig my hands wrist deep in pregnant earth, To watch a young bird, veering, learn to fly, To give a still, stark poem shining birth. To hear the rain drool, dimpling, down the drain And splash with a wet giggle in the street, To ramble in the twilight after supper, And to count the pretty faces that you meet. To ride to town on trolleys, crowded, teeming With joy and hurry and laughter and push and sweat — Squeezed next a patent-leathered Negro dreaming Of a wrinkled river and a minnow net. To buy a paper from a breathless boy, And read of kings and queens in foreign lands, Hyperbole of romance and adventure, All for a penny the color of my hand. To lean against a strong tree's bosom, sentient And hushed before the silent prayer it breathes, To melt the still snow with my seething body And kiss the warm earth tremulous underneath. Ah, life, to let your stabbing beauty pierce me And wound me like we did the studded Christ, To grapple with you, loving you too fiercely, And to die bleeding — consummate with Life.
Summer comes. The ziczac hovers 'Round the greedy-mouthed crocodile. A vulture bears away a foolish jackal. The flamingo is a dash of pink Against dark green mangroves, Her slender legs rivalling her slim neck. The laughing lake gurgles delicious music in its throat And lulls to sleep the lazy lizard, A nebulous being on a sun-scorched rock. In such a place, In this pulsing, riotous gasp of color, I met Magalu, dark as a tree at night, Eager-lipped, listening to a man with a white collar And a small black book with a cross on it. Oh Magalu, come! Take my hand and I will read you poetry, Chromatic words, Seraphic symphonies, Fill up your throat with laughter and your heart with song. Do not let him lure you from your laughing waters, Lulling lakes, lissome winds. Would you sell the colors of your sunset and the fragrance Of your flowers, and the passionate wonder of your forest For a creed that will not let you dance?
Ah, little road all whirry in the breeze, A leaping clay hill lost among the trees, The bleeding note of rapture streaming thrush Caught in a drowsy hush And stretched out in a single singing line of dusky song. Ah little road, brown as my race is brown, Your trodden beauty like our trodden pride, Dust of the dust, they must not bruise you down. Rise to one brimming golden, spilling cry!
Her eyes had caught a bit of loveliness, A flower blooming in the prison yard; She ran to it and pressed it to her lips, This Godsend of a land beyond the walls; She drank its divine beauty with her kiss. A guard wrested the flower from her hand-- With awful art her humble back laid bare, Soft skin and darker than a dreamless night; He tossed aside the burden of her hair. "I'll teach you to pick flowers in this yard. They ain't for n*****s." He began to flog. Her pale palmed hands grasped the thin air in quest Until, like two antalgic words, they fell And whispered something to her heaving breast. Then she forgot the misery of her back. Somehow she knew that God, her God was there: That what was pain was but her striped flesh. Her soul, inviolate, was havened in prayer. On a cross of bigotry she was crucified Because she was not white. And like her Father On the holyrood, whispered "Forgive." And in her eyes there shone a Candlemas light. He flung the whip into the flower bed He did not even see that she was dead. 
Where are the brave men? Where are the strong men? Pygmies rise and spawn the earth, Weak-kneed, weak-hearted and afraid! Afraid to face the counsel of their timid hearts, Afraid to look men squarely— Down they gaze With fatal fascination— Down, Down Into the whirling maggot-sands Of prejudice! 
Swift-footed Time, how eagerly you go Across the swaying summer grasses bed As on in breathless haste you hurry me To Winter with its chilling winds and snow.  The noontide hour is fading—in my hair The furtive shadows caper and recline. I tell my beads of amethyst and gold So near at end, so passing dear and fair. 
Yolk-colored tongue Parched beneath a burning sky, A lazy little tune Hummed up the crest of some Soft sloping hill. One streaming line of beauty Flowing by a forest Pregnant with tears. A hidden nest for beauty Idly flung by God In one lonely lingering hour Before the Sabbath. A blue- fruited black gum, Like a tall predella, Bears a dangling figure, Sacrificial dower to the raff, Swinging alone, A solemn, tortured shadow in the air.
It is silly-- This waiting for love In a parlor. When love is singing up and down the alley Without a collar. 
Ah love Is Like a throbbing wind, A lullaby all crooning, Ah love Is like a summer sea's soft breast. Ah love's  A sobbing violin That naive night is tuning, Ah love Is down from off the white moon's nest.
A shy ear bared For incipient kisses; A secret shared In laughter exquisite; Soft finger tips, While the night embraces, Touch passionate colors That morning erases And when the Dawn wakens, No attempt to recapture Those swift fleeting hours of ecstatic rapture, But hide the shy ear with a curl, my pet, And that little secret,-- forget. 
I do not ask for love,--ah! no,    Nor friendship's happiness, These were relinquished long ago    I search for something less. I seek a little, tranquil bark    In which to drift at ease Awhile, and then quite silently    To sink in quiet seas. 
When love’s triumphant day is done, Go forward! leave me to the night Beneath the coldly staring stars, The waiting winter and its blight.  Seek other, fairer lips, forget! Forbid your lightest thought to stray In simpie kindliness or grief Upon the closing backward way.  For I would never hold the heart That mutely quivers to be free. Unfurl your restless wings, away! And leave the emptiness to me! 
Is this the sea? This calm emotionless bosom, Serene as the heart of a converted Magdalene-- Or this? This lisping, lulling murmur of soft waters Kissing a white beached shore with tremulous lips Blue rivulets of sky gurgling deliciously O'er pale smooth stones-- This too? This sudden birth of unrestrained splendor, Tugging with turbulent force at Neptunes leash; This passionate abandon, This strange tempestuous soliloquy of Nature. All these--the Sea? 
I'm happy that you graduated high, It stirs my pride to see what you could do In these times, when our ways are all awry And threatened by the vulgar parvenu. Our noble name is linked with all the good New England yielded from her sterling worth, To make our country great and understood Among the greater nations of the earth. Our line is of a sturdy English breed, That sought an alien land for human rights; We always have insisted on the need Of viewing life from our own lofty heights. Only your great grandfather once went wrong, Becoming radical in slavery days, When party strife the country cleaved for long And petty agitators strove for praise. Remember to forget your great grand-father, Sometimes you worry me with traits like his, Shun sentimental liberals, but rather Uphold the law and give to charities.
My love has hair Like midnight, But midnight fades to dawn. My love has eyes Like starlight, But starlight fades in morn. My love has a voice Like dew fall. But dew-fall dies at a breath. My love has love Like life's all. But life's all fades in death.
Not as the white nations     know thee         O Mother! But swarthy of cheek     and full-lipped as the         child races are. Yet thou art she,     the Immaculate Maid,         and none other, Crowned in the stable     at Bethlehem,         hailed of the star. See where they come,     thy people,         so humbly appealing, From the ancient lands     where the olden faiths         had birth. Tired dusky hands     uplifted for thy         healing. Pity them, Mother,     the untaught         of earth.
There is a coarseness In the songs of black men  Of the sea. There is a weird strangeness In the songs of black men  Which sounds not strange To me. There is beauty In the faces of black women, Jungle beauty And mystery. Dark, hidden beauty In the faces of black women Which only black men See. Finality Trees are the souls of men Reaching skyward. And while each soul Draws nearer God Its dark roots cleave To earthly sod :    Death, only death    Brings triumph to the soul.    The silent grave alone    Can bare the goal.    Then roots and all    Must lie forgot    To rot.
Happiness  I went in quest of happiness Upon a golden mountain But she was in the plain below Beside the public fountain.  I sought her in the sea-blue waves And singing sun-lit billows But she was in the placid stream Beneath the shady willows.  I looked for her in city crowds That filled the great white way But found her on a lowly farm, A milkmaid, tawny, gay.  Death  My heart keeps a knockin’,—    Thump, thump, thump. My heart keeps a knockin',--    Bump, bump, bump. Some day Death is gonna answer de door Then my heart ain’t gonna knock no more An’ there won’t be no thump, thump, thump An’ there won’t be no bump, bump, bump. 
The past has gone, like a man that's dead, To pay his vows to eternity, The past has gone, like a parted soul, To place his myrrh and glimmering gold On the altar of eternity:    But dead men walk unheard, with silent tread--    The past goes blatant, with a foot like lead. 
FLAME-FLOWER, Day-torch, Mauna Loa, I saw a daring bee, today, pause, and soar,    Into your flaming heart; Then did I hear crisp, crinkled laughter As the furies after tore him apart?    A bird, next, small and humming, Looked into your startled depths and fled. .... Surely, some dread sight, and dafter    Than human eyes as mine can see, Set the stricken air waves drumming    In his flight. Day-torch, Flame-flower, cool-hot Beauty, I cannot see, I cannot hear your flutey Voice lure your loving swain, But I know one other to whom you are in beauty Born in vain: Hair like the setting sun, Her eyes a rising star, Motions gracious as reeds by Babylon, bar All your competing; Hands like, how like, brown lilies sweet, Cloth of gold were fair enough to touch her feet ... Ah, how the sense floods at my repeating, As once in her fire-lit heart I felt the furies Beating, beating.
Let the wind-rolled waves tell the tale of the sea, And the talkative pines tell the tale of the tree; Let the motored purr of an automobile Tell the hum-drum tale of power and steel. Let the blithesome chirp tell the tale of the bird, And sad, low sounds tell the tale of the herd; Then enthrone man on the dunce's stool And let his tale be the tale of a fool. 
Unto this last, Dear Love, unto this last; When it is past, then it is past. So comes the end as the end of winter, Flowers on limbs ice winds may splinter. But the tree that has borne her flowers and fruits And died from her leafless boughs unto her roots, Thirsts not for grass nor the robin’s quick wing, Cares not for spring, cares not for spring.
O' de wurl' ain't flat, An' de wurl' ain't roun', H'it's one long strip Hangin' up an' down— Jes' Souf an' Norf; Jes' Norf an' Souf.  Talkin' 'bout sailin' 'round de wurl'— Huh! I'd be so dizzy my head 'ud twurl. If dis heah earf wuz jes' a ball You no the people all 'ud fall.  O' de wurl' ain't flat, An' de wurl' ain't roun', H'it's one long strip Hangin' up an' down— Jes' Souf an' Norf; Jes' Norf an' Souf.  Talkin' 'bout the City whut Saint John saw— Chile you oughta go to Saginaw; A n*****'s chance is “finest kind,” An' pretty gals ain't hard to find.  Huh! de wurl' ain't flat, An' de wurl' ain't roun', Jes' one long strip Hangin' up an' down. Since Norf is up, An' Souf is down, An' Hebben is up, I'm upward boun'.
I return the bitterness,    Which you gave to me; When I wanted loveliness    Tantalant and free. I return the bitterness    It is washed by tears; Now it is a loveliness    Garnished through the years. I return it loveliness,    Having made it so; For I wore the bitterness    From it long ago.
Feet F-e-e-t Faces F-a-c-e-s Bodies B-o-d-i-e-s Tobacco scented B-O-D-I-E-S The Durham streets at dusk Are swarmed with color. It is the moving panorama Painted by the factory artist Each dusk.
I wonder If the man  To whom she gives her love: Sees her as the mother of his children, Or the woman for his body's pleasure?  The sad black girl upon his arm Goes to the factory each morning at seven. She works beside him the hours through. They trudge down Pettigrew Street each dusk.  She is his daily companion, his choice. She is snubbed by the shoppers of Fayetteville Street; Who forget that she makes them. I wonder if her husband too forgets?  I wonder If the man  To whom she gives her love: Sees her as the mother of his children, Or the woman for his body's pleasure?
I am but a leaf Clinging to the tree of life In the world's garden. * * * *  Last night I saw you,  A dream rose and I your stem; Showing you the sun. * * * *  They tear at my heart-- The days that knew no desire. For they were wasted. * * * * Night shadows woo me. I cling to the crescent moon Like the evening star. * * * *  The moon -- ah the moon Draped in the velvet of night Brocaded with stars.  * * * *  Do not bring lanterns I say, "Darkness is supreme Delight beyond words." * * * *  Drops of silver blood  Are falling from the sky's heart. All the world has woe. * * * *  O night of Shadows Seal my lips with your magic Of silent beauty! 
The dawn has no tint of rose,    Or seent of violet, And noon brings no sweet repose    To grapple with regret. Who has taken the stars,    Which gave a bashful light, Between the age-worn scars    Of the eternal night? I am a humming sea shell,    You are a boundless sea, Your lovely lyric waters    Flow on and under me. Teday is the day of love,    Tomorrow may not be, So live our lives as we may    And trust eternity. Give me your stars to hold    O sky of blue delight, Your moon of laughter gold    To diadem my night.

FORM    You stood in the yard  Like a lilac bush  With your head tossed high  As if to push  Your hair in a blossom  About your head  You wore the grace  Of a fragile reed.   FASHION  Your gown crackled loud  Like the swish of leaves  Being flitted about  By a lyric breeze  Your step was like a dainty fawn  Breathing the nectared air at dawn,  Oft have I seen the rose in you  But it never bloomed such a brilliant hue. 
From the factory doors The pageant pours Down the mud of Pettigrew Street. The sound of feet Treads on my heart And stupefies its beat.  The factories take my people's souls And give them out in smoke. Oh, why should souls be made to burn And spirits thus to choke?
Her eyes?      Dark pools of deepest shade      Like sylvan lakes that lie In some sequestered forest glade      Beneath a starry sky. Her cheeks?     The ripened chestnut’s hue,      Rich Autumn's sun-kissed brown! Caressed by sunbeams dancing through      Red leaves that flutter down. Her form?     A slender pine that sways      Before the murmuring breeze In summer, when the southwind plays      Soft music through the trees. Herself?     A laughing joyous sprite      Who smiles from dawn till dark, As lovely as a summer night      And carefree as a lark.
Dusk came dancing down the dale      Like a slim dark maiden, Crowned with blossoms sunset-pale,      Dream-perfumed, dew-laden.  Black as midnight were her eyes,      Crinkly-dark her tresses, Sunbeams, flickering from the skies      Wooed her with caresses.  Lingering but an instant’s space,      All my heart entrancing, Swift and sweet, her warm embrace      Stirred my blood to dancing.  But when Night, in splendor rare,      Set her love-lamps gleaming, Dusk had fled, and left me there      Lone, and lorn, and dreaming. 
GO THROUGH the gates with closed eyes. Stand erect and let your black face front the west. Drop the axe and leave the timber where it lies; A woodman on the hill must have his rest. Go where leaves are lying brown and wet. Forget her warm arms and her breast who mothered you, And every face you ever loved forget. Close your eyes; walk bravely through.
So while a lessening glint of sun ray Loiters golden in your hair, Pale girl, do you not mourn for memories of the morning? Would you not stay the failing beam? We who were born in the night know songs For the deep, cold watches of gloom. Lie down, O kith of the glorious day, And weep while Sorrow sings.  
You have been good to me, I give you this:  The arms of lovers empty as our own,  Marble lips sustaining one long kiss  And the hard sound of hammers breaking stone.    For I will build a chapel in the place  Where our love died and I will journey there  To make a sign and kneel before your face  And set an old bell tolling on the air. 
A little while spring will claim its own,  In all the land around for mile on mile  Tender grass will hide the rugged stone.  My still heart will sing a little while.    And men will never think this wilderness  Was barren once when grass is over all,  Hearing laughter they may never guess  My heart has known its winter and carried gall. 
Old Mansion By Arna Bontemps Poplars are standing there still as death And ghosts of dead men Meet their ladies walking Two by two beneath the shade And standing on the marble steps. There is a sound of music Echoing through the door And in the field there is Another sound tinkling in the cotton: Chains of bondsmen dragging on the ground. The years go back with an iron clank. A hand is on the gate, A dry leaf trembles on the wall. Ghosts are walking. They have broken roses down And poplars stand there still as death. 
I sought you long, your likeness in the sunsets Beckoning me; on my knees I came but you were not among the violets Nor underneath the lilac trees. The little tire you set to burn Is down to ash and near Love stands Drenched in rain. Turn Quintilla, O turn And think of how I sought your coal-black hands. 
You'll wait no more at the cedar tree alone, And at the quiet water’s edge : The wind passed over you and you were gone, So are the woods mure lonely than before. But if you flower again thus happily After all of death is past, Wait for me beside the slender tree And I will see you there and come at last. 
It grows with the thorn and wormwood Near the river of life, This tree, Whose fickle buds Bear twelve manner of fruit, And whose leaves are for an healing To the nations. It grows with the bitter wormwood On either side The throbbing river of the soul, This tree, Whose name is Love. 
Do you remember how that glowing morn We stood hands clasped beside an amber pool Of lilies pale as your fair skin, and cool On my brown cheek was the misty breath of dawn? You said, "We too are friends, for we were born To dwell at beauty's shrine. There is no rule That being brown and fair, we play the fool 'Til friendship flee, a tarnished gleam forlorn." 'Twas then I saw amid the thin-leaved grass Th souls of dead men and men yet to be; Blue fires, old thrilling hopes that leaped and died When you in dread, a childhood friend espied-- And seeing his slow smile, you shrank from me-- Then, ... my faith dead ... I turned ... and ... let ... you pass.
Great wonder that my blood spurts ruby read And not a green and slimy stream instead-- That all my tears are salt, not bigger gall, That I sill live, and love and laught at all! And that my teeth are lustrous, pearly white, Instead of blue cold blades that clash at night. Why do you stand aloof and bid me pray, You who sow strife and pain upon my way? How does my soul live on mauled by hate's rod? You cannot know 'twas made by One called God.
I want to slay all the things just things That they tell me I must do, I would drown them all in the tears | weep When each breathless day is through. I want to flee to a cool sand dune On a wind-swept beach where the humming tune Of the wind, and the waves, and the heart of me Drums in my ears, and my lips are wet with the tang of the sea. I want to feel the rain on my cheek, The thrill that comes from a lark’s long note, I want to see the sky at dawn thru the lacy green of a willow tree I want to look deep in a pool at night, and see the stars Flash flame like the fire in black opals.
You have the freedom of all the earth, But what of me? You receive the value of your mind's worth, But what of me? The air we breathe, the sights we see, Are they for you, too, and not for me? Oh, what of me? Ah, you may have the works of man, But God gives the beauties of the land– That's for me.
Your tears are wasted, maiden of my race.  There is no law that makes white kin to black;  And your lover swings there alone. Your tears are wasted, Maiden of my race. Loud, boisterous yells of the mob; Souless men who claim their blood, And sell as souvenirs the lean bones. The common and the noble herd are there, Amidst a thousand tongues acclaimed brave,  And the leader sits high on his throne. Brown maiden, you beat your bosom in despair, And hang on the corpse of your beloved. Your tears are wasted, One of my race.
Who puts his wagon to a star,      Shall drive it but a night. For unseen things will only bar      The ones that are in sight. Every man may be alert and quick,      But first he must be slow. The world is not so hard to lick,      But first a man must know. A dreaming life is a wasted one,      Look inwardly upon your soul: The battle fought will then be won,      And you have attained your goal.
Father Missouri takes his own.  These are the fields he loaned them,  Out of hearts’ fullness; gratuitously,  Here are the banks he built up for his children—  Here are the fields; rich, fertile silt.    Father Missourt, in his dotage  Whimsical and drunkenly turbulent,  Guts away the banks; steals away the loam;  Washes the ground from under wire fences,  Leaves fenceposts grotesquely dangling in the air;  And with doddering steps approaches the shanties.    Father Missouri; far too old to be so evil.   Uncle Dan, seeing his garden lopped away,  Seeing his manured earth topple slowly in the stream,  Seeing his cows knee-deep in yellow water,  His pig-sties flooded, his flower beds drowned,  Seeing his white leghorns swept down the stream—    Curses Father Missouri, impotently shakes  His fist at the forecloser, the treacherous skinflint,  Who takes what was loaned so very long ago,  And leaves puddles in his parlor, and useless lakes  In his fine pasture land.  Sees years of work turned to nothing—  Curses, and shouts in his hoarse old voice,  “Aint got no right to act dat way at all”  And the old river rolls on, slowly to the gulf. 
He'd play, after the bawdy songs and blues, After the weary plaints Of “Trouble, Trouble deep down in muh soul,” Always one song in which he'd lose the role Of entertainer to the boys. He'd say “My mother’s favorite.” And we knew That what was coming was his chant of saints “When de Saints go ma’chin home And that would end his concert for the day.  Carefully as an old maid over needlework, Oh, as some black deacon, over his Bible, lovingly, He'd tune up specially for this. There'd be No chatter now, no patting of the feet. After a few slow chords, knelling and sweet Oh when de saints go ma’chin home Oh when de sayaints goa ma'chin home He would forget The quieted bunch, his dimming cigarette Stuck into a splintered edge of the guitar. Sorrow deep hidden in his voice, a far And soft light in his strange brown eyes; Alone with his masterchords, his memories. . .    Lawd I wanna be one in nummer    When de saints go ma’chin home. Deep the bass would rumble while the treble, scattered high For all the world like heavy feet a trompin’ toward the sky. With shrillvoiced women getting ‘happy’ All to celestial tunes. The chap’s few speeches helped me understand The reason why he gazed so fixedly Upon the burnished strings.

There is pathetic beauty in it all;        O’erhead the murky, sullen rainclouds pass,        The sun’s first darting rays have pierced the mass, Just now so grim, so gray. Again the call Is heard of storm-hushed robins. Maples-tall,        To show the regal silver of their class,        Rustle their thirst-slaked leaves and on the grass, Drenched into higher colog, some last drops fall.  ’Tis like that heart, whose happiness excelled        All others, which, with its gay threshold crossed             At last by sorrow’s gloom, has fitly learned To stifle throes of pain, has ne’er rebelled              In angry bitterness, has merely turned Gayness to pathos, with no beauty lost. 
Out of the tense awed darkness, my Frangepani        comes; Whilst the blades of Heaven flash round her, and        the roll of thunder drums, My young heart leaps and dances, with exquisite        joy and pain, As storms within and storms without I meet my        love in the rain. “The rain is in love with you darling; it’s kissing        you everywhere, Rain pattering over your small brown feet, rain        in your curly hair; Rain in the vale that your twin breasts make, as        in delicate mounds they rise, I hope there is rain in your heart, Frangepani, as         rain half fills your eyes.” Into my hands she cometh, and the lightning of my        desire Flashes and leaps about her, more subtle than        Heaven's fire; “The lightning’s in love with you darling; it is        loving you so much, That its warm electricity in you pulses wherever        I may touch. When I kiss your lips and your eyes, and your        hands like twin flowers apart, I know there is lightning Frangepani, deep in the        depths of your heart.” The thunder rumbles about us, and I feel its tri-        umphant note As your warm arms steal around me; and I kiss        your dusky throat; “The thunder'’s in love with you darling. It hides        its power in your breast. And I feel it stealing o'er me as I lie in your arms        at rest. I sometimes wonder, beloved, when I drink from        life’s proffered bowl, Whether there's thunder hidden in the innermost        parts of your soul.” Out of my arms she stealeth; and I am left alone        with the night, Void of all sounds save peace, the first faint glim-        mer of light. Into the quiet, hushed stillness my Frangepani goes. Is there peace within like the peace without? Only        the darkness knows.
I love the black and rippling hair Of little Nina Clark, I love her beauty, fresh and rare, But oh! her skin is dark. II. I love the eyes, the lips, the teeth Of little Nina Clark, I love the virtue underneath That skin which is so dark. III. I might have married her some day, This lovely Nina Clark, But this one thing stands in the way— Her skin, which God made dark. 
Oh, haunting melodies of grief and pain; Oh, heart-wrung agonies distilled in song; Oh, moving minors—weird, pathetic strain; Oh, trembling cries forced by the cruel thong Of Hate! Oh whisperings of hope and faith, Breathing fidelity to Unseen Love, From bleeding, bruised souls lashed to the earth; Oh, soft appealing moans, potent to move Upon the calloused hearts of world-worn men; Sweet voices of my brothers from the past Dark night of slavery, dread era when These little ones were in its power held fast; Sad Sorrow Songs, you yet shall come to be Brave shouts of victory from Souls set free! 
Forgive me that my voice is low, And charged with sorrow my brief song, For I must sing—though brokenly, Who have been mute so long!  I cannot run the gamut through, The compass of my voice is small, My range is slight, but I must heed My heart's insistent call! These flutings, faint, a portent are, Of what the future years may bring, When soaring high, unfettered, free, My 'raptured soul shall sing! And though this plaintive pleading now, Irks with its minor, wistful wailing, You feel the passion, sense the power, Which yet may prove availing. For caught within my simple song. Is zealous ardor, fervent feeling; And deep emotion's cleansing flame, My burgeoning self revealing.
Night is a velvet cloak Wrapped ’round a gay Lothario; Day is a flash-light In the hand of a prude.
The rain has hung her washing out The earth is cool and dry Dirty faces are descried in silver pools Of water as men go by.
My words shall drip Like molten lava From the towering black volcano, On the sleeping town ’Neath its summit. My thoughts shall be Hot ashes Burning all in its path. I shall not stop Because critics sneer, Nor stoop to fawning At man’s mere fancy. I shall breathe A clearer freer air For I shall see the sun Above the crowd,  I shall not blush And make excuse When a son of Adam, Who calls himself “God’s Layman,” Slashes with scorn A thing born from Truth’s womb and nursed By beauty. It will not Matter who stoops To cast the first stone. Does not my spirit Soar above these feeble Minds? thoughts born From prejudice’s womb And nursed by tradition?  I will shatter the wall Of darkness that rises From gleaming day And seeks to hide the sun. I will turn this wall of  Darkness (that is night) Into a thing of beauty. I will take from the hearts Of black men-- Prayers their lips  Are 'fraid to utter. And turn their coarseness Into a beauty of the jungle Whence they came. The lava from the black volcano Shall be words--the ashes--thoughts  Of all men.
My thoughts soared up To the starless sky And a cloud Passed over the face Of the yellow moon. My thoughts Are the clouds that hide The face of the moon, And yours are The night wind That blows away the ugly Moon clouds. 
I used to sit on a high green hill And long for you to be like the clouds, Soft and white.......... And you eyes be like heaven's blue And your hair like the tree sifted sun.......... But then I was young, and my eyes yet Round with wonder. Now I site by an endless road and watch  As you come..........swiftly like dusk Your hair like a staless night Your eyes like deep violet shadows, And soft arms cradle me on your sweet Brown breast..........for I have grown old And my eyes hold unshed tears, And my face is lean and hard in daylight's Mocking glare. But with the night Dusk fingers and lips like dew Erase each wound of time And my eyes grow round with wonder  At your beauty. 
My body Is an ugly thing Fashioned by God. My body Is an empty thing Made from crumbling sod. My soul Is a lovely thing Fashioned by God. My soul  Is a flaming thing That trampling hordes Have left untrod. 
 Like you   Letting down your   Purpled shadowed hair   To hide the rose and gold   Of your loveliness   And your eyes peeping thru   Like beacon lights   In the gathering darkness. 
The wind blows. My soul is like a tree Lifting its face to the sun, Flinging wide its branches To catch the falling rain,    To breathe into itself a fragrance Of far-off fields of clover, Of hidden vales of violets,— The wind blows,— It is spring! The wind blows. My soul is like sand, Hot, burning sand That drifts and drifts Caught by the wind, Swirling, stinging, swarting, Silver in the moonlight. Soft breath of lovers’ feet Lulled to sleep by the lap of waves, The wind blows— It is summer! The wind blows. My soul is still In silent reverie Hearing sometimes a sigh As the frost steals over the land Nipping everywhere. Earth is dead. The woods are bare. The last leaf is gone. Nipped by death’s bitter frost, My youth grown grey Awaits the coming of The new year. The wind blows,— It is winter!
To dance— In the light of moon, A platinum moon Poised like a slender dagger On the velvet darkness of night.  To dream— ’Neath the bamboo trees On the sable breast Of earth— And listen to the wind.  To croon— Weird sweet melodies Round the cabin door With banjos clinking softly— And from out the shadow Hear the beat of tom-toms Resonant through the years.  To plunge— My brown body In a golden pool, And lazily float on the swell Watching the rising sun.  To stand— On a purple mountain Hidden from earth By mists of dreams And tears—  To talk— With God.  
My sweet, red blood to snuff the Yellow hate, My proud, White flesh a Black girl’s pangs to ease, My muscles wrenched a Red-skin’s wrongs to crush, My entire body diced to clean the slate, Sheer mock-heroics? They'll have love of me: The long-enduring, mystical Chinese, The colored girls whose goodness makes me blush, The kind-faced squaws who peddle basketry. They'll have it. Great God, surely it is right? He taught it . . . Thy son pleasing in Thy sight— No dawdling, half-way measures satisfy— I must earn sure approval in Thine eye. Failing, I plunge (may nothing me exempt) In cauldron—seething, scalding self-contempt.
A hungry cancer will not let him rest Whose heart is loyal to the least of dreams; There is a thorn forever in his breast Who cannot take his world for what it seems. Aloof and lonely must he ever walk, Plying a strange and unaccustomed tongue, An alien to the daily round of talk, Mute when the sordid songs of earth are sung. This is the certain end his dream achieves: To sweat his blood and prayers while others sleep, To shoulder his own coffin up the steep, Incredulous summit that shapes his doom Between two wretched dying men, of whom One doubts, and one for pity’s sake believes.
Sonnet to Her  HOW have I found this favor in her sight, And will the flame burn steady to the end, Until we round that dark and dangerous bend Where.there is such a crying need for light; Or will it flare up now so clear and bright, Sunlike its wealth so far and wide distend That nothing will remain for us to spend When toll is taken by the dismal night? Why shculd I harrow up my mind like this,  To tarnish with a doubt each golden kiss? This is the Day most certainly! This bars Us now from any hidden darkness spun; Sufficient to the day let be the sun, And to the night the spear-points of the stars. 
To John Haynes Holmes  (Read at the Testimonial Dinner to John Haynes Holmes in recognition of his twenty years as Minister of the Community Church of New York City.)  By COUNTEE CULLEN  Cnce in a thousand years a call may ring Divested so of every cumbering lie A man espousing it may fight and sing, And count it but a little thing to die; Once in a thousand years a star may come Six-pointed, tipped with such an astral flow It’s singing sisters must bow hushed dumb, Half-mutinous, yet half-adoring show; Once in as many years a man may rise So cosmopolitan of thought and speech, Humanity reflected in his eyes, His heart a haven every race may reach, That doubters shall receive a mortal thrust, And own “This man proves flesh exalts its dust”. 
Cry Shame upon me if you must,  Shout Treason and Default,  Say I betray a sacred trust  Aching beyond this vault.  I'll bear your censure as your praise,  Yet never shall a clan  Confine my singing to its ways  Beyond the ways of man.    No racial option narrows grief; Pain is no patriot;  And sorrow braids her dismal leaf  For all as lief as not.  With blind sheep groping every hill  Seeking an oriflamme,  What shepherd heart would keep its fill  For only the darker lamb?  
There are some things I might not know  Had you not pedagogued me so;  And these I thank you for,  Now never shall a piquant face  Cause my tutored heart a trace  Of anguish any more.    Before your pleasure made me wise,  A simulacrum of disguise  Masked the serpent and the dove;  That I discern now hiss from coo,  My heart's full gratitude to you,  Lady I had learned to love.    Before I knew love well I sang  Many a polished pain and pang,  With proper bardic zeal;  But now I know hearts do not break  So easily, and though a snake  Has made them wounds may heal. 
Shall I go all my bright days singing,  (A little pallid, a trifle wan)  The failing note still vainly clinging  To the throat of the stricken swan?    Shall I never feel and meet the urge  To bugle out beyond my sense  That the fittest song of earth is a dirge,  And only fools trust Providence?    Than this better the reed never turned flute,  Better than this no song,  Better a stony silence, better a mute  Mouth and a cloven tongue. 
“I must be ready when he comes,” she said, “Besieger of the heart, the long adored; And I shall know him by his regal tread, And by the grace peculiar to my lord. Upon my mouth his lips shall be a sword; Splendid is he by whom this breast shall fall, This hive of honey burst, this fruit be cored.” So beauty that would be a willing thrall Kept vigil, eyes aglow, ear tuned to hear his call. Had she not had her dream, she might have seen For what he was the stranger at her gate, And known his rugged hands, strong mouth, and lean Hawk-face spelled out for her a star-spun fate. But captive to a dream she let him wait In vain for any word she might have said Whereat he might declare himself her mate. She looked him through as one unknown or dead; He passed, an unseen halo blazing round his head. The grave will be her only lover now, Though still she watches for the shining one, Her prince in purple robes, with flaming brow, Astride a wild steed lineaged from the sun. Season to season shades, the long days run To longer years; she still is waiting there, Not knowing long ago her siege was done, Not dreaming it has been her bitter share To entertain her heart’s high guest all unaware.
When the earth was finished God papered the ceiling And walls with sky. He then hung out the moon And fixed the stars in place.
Not to dance with her Was such a trivial thing. There were girls more fair than she,— Today Ten girls dressed in white. Each had a white rose wreath. They made a dead man’s arch And ten strong men Carried a body through. Not to dance with her Was a trivial thing.
A poor old faded rose is she From which the bloom is gone; Caressed by a hundred hands, And pricked by a hundred thorns.
Leave me alone And let me think Of things that were, And things that might have been If only you had made My dreams come true.
Out of the hush of night, Out of the sob of morn, Out of the sigh of noon, Thy soul was born.  Part of the gentle tears That dim fair April’s eyes, Part of the gladsome smiles That warm her skies;  Grace of the violet shy, Fragrance of new-born rose, Beauty of every flower That woodland grows;  Softness of mild May winds, Sweetness of days in June; Lilt from a melody Of heavenly tune;  Out of the ages past, Out of the years to be; Out of his vast unknown God fashioned thee.  
Lie broken in the dark, cool loam You still enrich, not with your force now, But with your peace. You are a home Where I return for wisdom, how  To know my own dark roots and this Day’s newer race, a mute, mysterious Past, whose shrouded sorrow is A sign the fates have set us.  Nor are you as a past we scorn; No mock was yours to us unknown. We who to daily shame are born Learn from you in whom our seed is sown.  But tragedy is more than token; Here life and beauty lie frustrate, As lie unnumbered broken Races in the soil of every state. 
That Hill This poem won honorable mention in THE CRISIS contest of 1926.  IT crawled away from ’neath my feet, And left me standing there; A little at a time, went up An atmospheric stair.  I couldn’t go for watching it, To see where it would stop; A tree sprang out and waved to me When it had reached the top.  The tree kept nodding friendly like, Beckoning me to follow; And I went crawling up and up, Like it did from the hollow.  Then I saw why the thing would go A-soaring from the dell— T’was nearing Heaven every bound, And fleeing fast from Hell! 
She screamed but no one heard her. . . Her body was a silencer. She cried and never moved a tear…  Her heart was broken, tears dripped there. Silent, she seemed content to lay Her soul awhile in fresh red clay. Proud to stand, all grief defying . . . We knew that she was all but dying.
Ah, I know what happiness is… It is a timid little fawn Creeping softly up to me For one caress, then gone Before I'm through with it…  Away, like dark from dawn! Well I know what happiness is…  It is the break of day that wears A shining dew decked diadem…  An aftermath of tears. Fawn and dawn, emblems of joy…  I've played with them for years, And always they will slip away Into the brush of another day. Is a human heart more brazen Than a floating, fleecy cloud Pillowed on the sky's blue bosom, Kissing stars before the crowd Of earthly prudes, all forgiving Secret passions of the earth Seducing a virgin seed Till a bastard tree makes birth? Is a human heart immodest More so than a cold steel pin Staggering to a magnet, waiting, Or a hen bird fluttering when Her mate calls? Can it be sin? Consummation of God's mating. Proof that love needs no berating.
My branch of thoughts is frail tonight  As one lone wind-whipped weed.  Little I care if a rain drop laughs  Or cries; I cannot heed    Such trifles now as a twinkling star,  Or catch a night-bird’s tune.  My whole life ts you, to-night,  And you, a cool distant moon.    With a few soft words to nurture my heart  And brighter beams following love’s cool shower  Who knows but this frail wind-whipped weed  Might bear you a gorgeous flower! 
Sometimes it seems that only cowards live With weighted hearts each day; It seems braver far to take life up and go A solitary way. It seems a self reliant soul should know When life has palled, And win applause for surprising God . . . Going in . . . uncalled.  Poor vain, gallant hero, If the journey ended at the grave I would cheer you . . . or perhaps I'd go And wear the laurels of the brave.  But no! I rather choose to stay And trust the clouds to blow away. I'll blink and peer through fog of doubt Until God blows my candle out . . . 
 April is on the way!    I saw the scarlet flash of a blackbird’s wing  As he sang in the cold, brown February trees;  And children said that they caught a glimpse of the sky on a bird’s wing from the far South.     (Dear God, was that a stark figure outstretched in   the bare branches  Etched brown against the amethyst sky?)     April is on the way!     The ice crashed in the brown mud-pool under my   tread,     The warning earth clutched my hluody feet with   great fecund fingers.     I saw a boy rolling a hoop up the road,     His little bare hands were red with cold,     But his brown hair blew backward in the southwest   wind.     (Dear God! He screamed when he saw my awful   woe-spent eyes.)     April is on the way!     I met a woman in the lane;     Her burden was heavy as it is always, but today   her step was light,     And a smile drenched the tired look away from her   eyes.     (Dear God, she had dreams of vengeance for her   slain mate,     Perhaps the west wind has blown the mist of hate   from her heart,     The dead man was cruel to her, you know that,     God.)     April is on the way!     My feet spurn the ground now, instead of dragging   on the bitter road.     I laugh in my throat as I see the grass greening be-   side the patches of snow     (Dear God, those were wild fears. Can there be   hate when the southwest wind is blowing?)     April is on the way!     The crisp brown hedges stir with the bustle of bird   Wings.     There is business of building, and songs from brown   thrush throats     As the bird-carpenters make homes against Valen-   tine Day.     (Dear God, could they build me a shelter in the   hedge from the icy winds that will come   with the dark?)     April is on the way!     I sped through the town this morning. The florist   shops have put yellow flowers in the win-   dows,     Daffodils and tulips and primroses, pale yellow   flowers     Like the tips of her fingers when she waved me that   frightened farewell.     And the women in the market have stuck pussy wil-   lows in long necked bottles on their stands.     (Willow trees are kind, Dear God. They will not   bear a body on their limbs.)     April is on the way!     The soul within me cried that all the husk of in-   difference to sorrow was but the crust of ice   with which winter disguises life;     It will melt, and reality will burgeon forth like the   crocuses in the glen.     (Dear God! Those thoughts were from long ago.   When we read poetry after the day’s toil.   and got religion together at the revival   meeting.)     A pril is on the way!     The infinite miracle of unfolding life in the brown   February fields.     (Dear God, the hounds are baying!)     Murder and wasted love, lust and weariness, deceit   and vainglory—what are they but the spent   breath of the runner?     (God, you know he laid hairy red hands on the     golden loveliness of her little daffodil body)   Hate may destroy me, but from my brown limbs   will bloom the golden buds with which we   once spelled love.   (Dear God! How their light eyes glow into black   pin points of hate!)     A pril is on the way!     Wears are made in April, and they sing at Easter   time of the Resurrection.     Therefore I laugh in their faces.     (Dear God, give her strength to join me before her     . golden petals are fouled in the slime!)     April is on the way! 
Lonely log cabin On the road to Nostalgia, Sighing and sagging and quaking; Letme breath to the heart of your walls A secret-- To keep it from breaking. Once in a Harlem cellar, A brown girl, Wiggling and strutting In a stranger's arms, Dreaming of you For a God-given moment-- Forgot to proffer her charms. 
I  “The sea compels me; sister I must go Nay! Do not hold me,—I’m of age you know! I am a Breton and of noble birth. The pathway of the ocean draws me so!”  “But, brother, if you leave, what good am I on earth? Without you, dear, my life is poor and cold. Ah! stir not from our fold! Remain with me until we both are old! Our mountain life is happy, brother dear. And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so clear!”  II  “Upon a vessel which shall bear your name A captain I’ll return, but still the same. Within three years we'll own these woods, this land; And lords of all we'll be, and all will claim.”  “But think,” said she, “what more can you demand? Our cottage rises from the earth’s brown mold, And happy, happy is our humble fold. Remain with me until we both are old!  Our mountain life is happy, brother dear, And then in Brittainy the sunlight is so clear!”  Ill  But he must leave her though the heavens fall. Ten lonely years—no word from him no call! Beside the hearth his sister, his best friend, Wept, constant, wearing sorrow as a pall. Then suddenly her grief comes to an end. One day a sailor, shipwrecked, racked with cold, Sought shelter. “You! My brother, grown so old!” “Yes, sister mine, I’ve come back to the fold. This mountain life will heal my suffering drear. And sweetest Brittainy, thy sunlight is so clear!” 
WHEN face to face we stand    And eye to eye, How far apart we are — As far, they say, as God can ever be From what, they say, is Hell. But, when we stand Fronting the other, Mile after mile slipping in between, O, close we are, As close as is the shadow to the body, As breath, to life, ........ As kisses are to love.
The days fall upon me; One by one, they fall, Like leaves. . . . They are black, They are grey. They are white; They are shot through with gold and fire. They fall, They fall Ceaselessly. They cover me, They crush, They smother. Who will ever find me Under the days? 
1 She has not found herself a hard pillow    And a long hard bed, A chilling cypress, a wan willow    For her gay young head...     These are for the dead.                             2 Does the violet-lidded twilight die    And the piercing dawn And the white clear moon and the night- blue sky. . .    When they are gone? 3 Does the shimmering note In the shy, shy throat Of the swaying bird? 4 O, does children's laughter Live not after It is heard? 5 Does the dear, dear shine upon dear, dear things, In the eyes, on the hair, On waters, on wings . Live no more anywhere? 6 Does the tang of the sea, the breath of frail flowers,    Of fern crushed, of clover, Of grasses at dark, of the earth after showers    Not linger, not hover? 7 Does the beryl in tarns, the soft orchid in haze, The primrose through tree-tops, the unclouded jade Of the north sky, all earth's flamings and russets and grays    Simply smudge out and fade? 8 And all loveliness, all sweetness, all grace, All the gay questing, all wonder, all dreaming, They that cup beauty that veiled opaled vase, Are they only the soul of a seeming? 9 O, hasn't she found just a little, thin door And passed through and closed it between? O, aren't those her light feet upon that light floor, ... That her laughter? . . . O, doesn't she lean As we do to listen? . . . O, doesn't it mean    She is only unseen, unseen?
She kneeled before me begging      That I should with a prayer Give her absolution      (How golden was her hair!) She begged an absolution      While the moments fled, She thought my tears were pity       (My Soul, her lips were red!) She begged of me forgiveness,      God you understand (For pale and soft and slender      Was her dainty hand!) She begged that I should pray You      That her Soul might rest But I could not pray, O Master      (Ivory was her breast!)
This is the place where strangers meet  And break a friendly bread  This is the place where the wanderer  May rest his weary head .. .    This is the place where songs are sung  Where winter’s tales are told  This is the place for broken dreams  When they grow worn and old...    This is the place of As-You-Will  Come in—abide—depart  This is the place I offer you  This place—my heart. . . . 
Go trace the brilliance Of a shooting star Across the sky And learn O timid Soul That happiness is but a shooting star That glows in tempting beauty but to die. . . . Go find a lonely rose beyond the hill Hid in the twilight while the world is still And take that tender blossom Within your cupped hand And shed your burning tears of anguish there Upon the rose .... for roses understand. . . Go sing your soft lament Unto the night And let the darkness kiss your fevered lips And wrap you 'round with one prolonged embrace And whisper to your love To be at peace. . . . Go seek the story of a nightingale Go seek the council of a lonely loon And learn of them That from this world you are apart A minor grace-note To a major tune. . . . 
God’s Garden  GOD nurtures in his garden many fruits. Some, very slow of growth, become at last Sweet and enduring. Some put forth their shoots With hasty promise, bloom and soon are past. Each has its season and the husbandman Waits patiently, remembering that each Must strive within its nature as it can Its own appointed destiny to reach. So patiently the eye of faith can see The nettle-blooms of war and hate increase, While slowly through the ages grows that tree Whose leaves are healing and whose fruit is peace. 
“He Knows Life” FRANK HORNE  HE knows Life They said— And I went up and opened the book of life. There on the first line Was written in what he knows of life— And on that first page Were a million other lines And in that book Were a myriad other pages and the press of life Was busy with new leaves And yet “He knows Life .. .” They said. 
Down in Georgia  a danglin’ n***** hangin’ in a tree  ....kicks holes in the laughing sunlight—        A little red haired        Irish girl . . . grey eyes        and a blue dress—        A little black babe        in a lacy white cap...        The soft red lips        of the little red head        kiss        so tenderly        the little black head—        grey eyes smile        into black eyes        and the gay sunlight        laughs joyously        in a burst of gold...        Down in Georgia        a danglin’ n*****       hangin’ in a tree  ...kicks holes in the laughing sunlight— 
I am a knotted nebula—  awhirling flame  Shrieking aftire the endless darkness...  I am the eternal center of gravity  and about me swing the crazy moons—  I am the thunder of rising suns,  the blaze of the zenith—  ... the tremble of women’s bodies  in the arms of lovers...  I sit on top of the Pole   Drunk with starry splendor  Shouting hozzanas at the Pleiades  ... booting footballs at the moon—  I shall outlast the sun  and the moon  and the stars. 
Let’s go see old Abe Sitting in the marble and the moonlight, Sitting lonely in the marble and the moonlight, Quiet for ten thousand centuries, old Abe. Quiet for a million, million centuries. Quiet,—and yet a voice forever Against the timeless walls of time, Old Abe.
Once you were beautiful,— Now, Hunched in the cold, Nobody cares That you are old.  Once you were lovely, —  Now, In the street, No one remembers Your lips were sweet.  Oh, withered old woman Of rue Fontaine Nobody but Death Will kiss you again 
It’s because you are so young,— You do not understand.      But we are old      As the jungle trees      That bloomed forever;      Old as the forgotten rivers      That flowed into the earth. Surely we know what you do not know:      Joy of living,      Uselessness of things. You are too young to understand yet.      Build another skyscraper      Touching the stars. We sit with our backs against a tree And watch skyscrapers tumble And stars forget.      Solomon built a temple      And it must have fallen down.      It isn’t here now. We know some things, being old, You do not understand. 
I see a woman with wings Trying to escape from a cage And the cage door Has fallen on her wings. They are long wings Which drag on the ground When she stands up, Rut she hasn’t enough strength To pull them away  
There Is no sweetness In the kiss Of a mouth Unwarm and dead And even passion's Flaming bliss Turns ashen In a charnel bed. Salome Of the wine red lips, What would you with Death's head?
Raindrops On the crumbling walls Of tradition, Sunlight Across mouldy pits Of yesterday.  Oh, Wise old men, What do you say About the fiddles And the jazz And the loud Hey ! Hey ! About the dancing girls, And the laughing boys, And the Brilliant lights, And the blaring joys, The firecracker days And the nights,–  Love-toys?  Staid old men, What do you say About sun-filled rain Drowning yesterday?
Gay little devils That hide in gin And tickle black boys Under the chin And make them laugh, Gay little devils That lurk in kisses, And shine in the eyes Of ebony misses, Shine in their eyes: Whee-e-el! O-o-o-o . . . Boom! Jazz band in a cabaret! The quick red hour Before the day.
Desire to us Was like a double death. Swift dying Of our mingled breath, Evaporation Of an unknown strange perfume Between us quickly In a naked room.
The naughty child Who ventured to go cut flowers, Fell into the mill-pond And was drowned. But the good children all Are living yet, Nice folks now In a very nice town.
She lived in sinful happiness And died in pain, But she danced in sunshine And laughed in rain. She went one summer morning When flowers spread the plain But she told my mother She was coming back again. The old folks made a coffin And hid her deep in earth Seems like she said: My body Brings new birth. For sure there grew flowers And tall young trees And sturdy weeds and grasses To sway in the breeze. And sure she lived in growing things With no pain And laughed in sunshine And danced in rain.
Jazz? Remember that song About the winds in the trees Singing me pretty melodies? Was nice, wasn’t it? Hear that violin? Say, Buddy, you know It’s spring in the country Where flowers grow. Play, jazz band! I’m tired. — O, gee! Sure, go ahead, Buy a drink for me. 
I went walkin’ By de blue bayou An’ I saw de sun go down. I thought about old Greeley An’ I thought about Lou, ~ An’ I saw de sun go down.    White man    Makes me work all day,    An’ I works damn hard    For damn little pay,    Then a white man takes    Ma woman away—    I'll kill old Greeley.    An’ de blue bayou turns red as fire.    Put the n***** on a rope    An’ pull him higher! An’ I saw de sun go down.    Put the n***** on a rope    An’ pull him higher! De blue bayou’s a pool o’ fire, An’ I saw de sun go down,    Down,        Down, Lawd! I saw de sun go down.
Today I go back to the sea And the wind-beaten rise of the foam. Today I go back to the sea— And it’s just as though I were home. It’s just as though I were home again On this ship of iron and steam, And it’s just as though I have found again The broken edge of a dream. 
 I take my dreams   And make of them a bronze vase,   And awide round fountain   With a beautiful statue in its center,   And a song with a broken heart,   And I ask you:   Do you understand my dreams?   Sometimes you say you do —   And sometimes you say you don't.   Either way   It doesn’t matter.   I continue to dream.  
Where most surely comes a day When all the sweets you've gourged Will turn your stomach sick And all the friends you've loved Will go away And every gold swift hour Will be an hour of pain And every sun-filled cloud A cloud of rain And even the withered flowers Will lose their long-held faint perfume And you alone will be with you In that last room,— Only your single selves together Facing a single doom.
Clutching at trees and clawing rocks And panting and climbing Until he reached the top A tiger in India Surmounted a cliff one day When the hunters were behind him And his lair was far away. A black and golden tiger Climbed a red cliff’s side And men in black and golden gowns Sought the tiger's hide. O, splendid, supple animal: Against the cliff's red face: A picture for an Indian screen Woven in silks of subtle sheen And broidered in yellow lace, A picture for an Indian screen As a prince's gift to some ebony queen In a far-off land like a fairy scene.
Because you are to me a song- I must not sing you overlong. Because you are to me a prayer I cannot say you everywhere. Because you are to me a rose You will not stay when summer goes.
You were the last bulwark of my dreams, And now you, too, have tumbled down into the dust. You, too, are no more than a broken lie.    Something    came between us    green and slimy    like sickly laughter    and a bowl was broken    from which    we could not drink thereafter    and we turned around    and threw    the shattered bits    upon the ground    and went our separate ways    into the town    and a clock    somewhere in a tower    boomed out slowly    hour after hour    a great cracked    broken sound. You were the last bulwark of my dreams, And now you, too, have tumbled down.
Men who ride strange wild horses Down dangerous glens and glades, Men who draw keen sharp swords, Toledo or Damascus blades, Men who swear and laugh and love And live and sing like troubadours,— Wrinkled old beldams somewhere Are dreaming of old amours. 
You are disdainful and magnificent- Your perfect body and your pompous gait, Your dark eyes flashing solemnly with hate, Small wonder that you are incompetent To imitate those whom you so despise Your shoulders towering high above the throng, Your head thrown back in rich, barbaric song, Palm trees and mangoes stretched before your eyes. Let others toil and sweat for labor's sake And wring from grasping hands their meed of gold. Why urge ahead your supercilious feet? Scorn will efface each footprint that you make. I love your laughter arrogant and bold. You are too splendid for this city street!
Too late to roll the tangled skein  The knot is taut, what might have been Passed with the pangs of yesterday— The secret page of history.  Red blood and white and black combine— Can you dissever yours from mine? Such motifs are not thus undone, Like prowess might command the sun.  Too late to roll the tangled skein, At first perhaps, this might have been, ‘Tis now too hard and passing late To disentwine the threads of Fate! 
 I weep these tears upon my bier      Another may not shed,   For there is none save I alone      Who knows that I am dead. 
Would I might mend the fabric of my youth Which daily flaunts its tatters to my eyes, Would I might compromise awhile with Truth Until Love's moon, now waxing, wanes and dies.  For I would go a further while with you And drain this Cup of Joy so passing fair, Which meets my parched lips like cooling dew 'Ere Time has brushed cold fingers thru my hair.
I’m tired of pacing the petty round of the ring of the thing I know—  I want to stand on the daylight’s edge and see where the sunsets go.  I want to sail on a swallow’s tail and peep through the sky’s blue glass.  I want to see if the dreams in me shall perish or come to pass.   I want to look through the moon’s pale crook and gaze on the moon-man’s face.  I want to keep all the tears I weep and sail to some unknown place. 
Hey, ho, Hasting! Hear me sing, dis song. Hurry, Hasting, 'Cause my time ain't long!  Strollin' up Hasting With a roamin' min'. Wonderin', wonderin', Jus' what I can fin'.

Bespangled and dipt in fire of stars the robe I wrap around my aching form and lie In ecstacy beneath the world-old skies And stretch my arms to those who lost my love When they would seek a mine that held the gods Of every pagan realm; and through my veins The ancient warmth diffuses riotous And eager for eternal cooling breath.  For I who wandered through a maze of curse And knew the scorn of those I strove to aid Have found a newer realm, a sacred grove Where I can woo that star-crowned maid of dusk Who brought to light a brood of sorrow folk And place on her a wedding ring of flowers That none but God can break.  Tis good to know She walks and chants her songs no man can sing And hear her voice in every scented breeze;  For she has waited long that I should come And hid herself among a faithful few In cave whose seal responds to magic’s charm. But now that starry scented night has dropt  To earth she glides to me and clasps me hard And presses on my lips a natal kiss And bids me let the curses die; for man Can weave no curse that lives, nor stay sweet love.   I revel here a thousand thousand nights And elves do dance around my wedding couch  And ever in my arms the maid o’dusk And ever in my dreams her tender love That guides me o'er a thousand thousand streams.  Then blow your pipes and let your minstrelsy Bloom golden ’neath a starry canopy; For all the years have come and death is cold And wrapt in shroud and laid in catacomb. 
I have seen my little black Nellie gal-all naked! She was wearing a beach-robe of black and       gold over one-piece bathing togs of  blue and white. She was strolling and singing and dancing       'long a silver sand-clad river bank. Trimmed with budding cane and tiny-      leafed drooping willows.     I saw the tilt of her plump black breast      Beneath that robe of black and gold    Would its young beauty stand the test      Of flames that brown lips hold?  I'd like to take her lithe dark body in my arms  And gently squeeze from it Rich juices of poetry and song. For she's a slim gay gal with a heart and a song and a smile, With a strut and a love for jazz!  As Nellie was singing and strolling and       dancing 'long that silver sand-clad river bank, She didn't see me sitting over there behind       those drooping willows that waved by  the silver river. She didn't know I was feasting on the de-      licious rhythm of her liquid movements…. And the sweet charm of her soft slim body–  Dark as the depths of Bantu-land And as near the teeming earth where God is.  Nellie thought she was out there by herself … nobody peeping. For she looked as free as the tall slim pines      brushing bits of white clouds from the sky on the other side of the silver      river, As she skipped along that silver beach, Her little black feet sinking up to her danc-      ing ankles in silver sand.  Nellie threw back her head and smiled at her lover, the Sun. She stretched her snake-like body up towards mighty heavens She relaxed with a sigh in the arms of the sun-glow. Ah! thought I, with a thrill and a jump. The dance to the Sun and the Silver River!  She flung off her robe of black and gold And danced to the Sun and the Silver River A dance primitive as the earth, mother of       gods. She sang a song as she danced there in the       silver sand– A song ripe with oldness and teeming with newness,       like the god-bearing earth, 'Neath pillared Angkor's mighty shades      Her palm-like body sways in dance. Now slow, now mad. The rhythm fades,      Dissolves itself in air ... By chance Her flowered tunic falls away,      (The frantic dance goes on and on) And shows her flesh in glad array Adorned with gems from Askalon. Nellie flung aside her suit of blue and white. The Sun pretended to hide his face behind a      little piece of white cloud. But the sun was just fooling; he looked      right through that veil of cloud at my Nellie. I got kind of jealous when the Sun looked      at my Nellie with no clothes on. Nellie danced on. She shook herself, Like a doe jumping up from good healthful      sleep In shaded woodlands By singing rivulets And maiden springs– Springs that whine like a brown gal longing      for loving. Nellie kept singing and dancing, Singing a song mellow with many years,      and new,– Like the great god-bearing earth: She floats in honey-tinted sighs,      She trips about on wings of song. Desire beckons her with cries      Of, "Perfect happiness ere long!" She's frankincense and myrrh, I ween.      Her countenance is fair. Her head the proudest ever seen      Bedecked with silk-black hair. Nellie's wild black hair fell loose, Half veiling her beaming black face Soft as finest chamois. She lingered wantonly towards the edge of      the silver water. And placed her slender dark hands on her      strong supple hips, And gazed down upon her unclad self, Her face aglow with mother-longing, Like the mighty earth, mother of all the      great gods of Black Folk. With golden bracelets 'round her arm,      A red rose in her hair, Her soul is autumn-brown and warm.      A poet's dream is living there. Her darting, cutting, dashing eyes      Half-closed, yet full of fire, Ope wide, then close with mild surprise,      To trap some some eager sire. From side to side she swayed her comely hips, Palm-like beneath the peeping giggling Sun. Her step was firm, now weak, now pleading To the Sun, her lover; Now defiant, now ranting, now expressive of flight Before her rival The Silver River. The muscles of her swift black legs were taut, Ready to run errands for her lover the Sun. The soft curves of her neck, The mellow outlines of her back Flowed clearly . . . then confusedly, As the dance got faster and faster. I saw her dimpled knees, like smiling baby's cheeks. I saw her tender breasts springing regularly, Tipped with polished bronze, Teeming with passion, Pouting for love. A drooping willow raised his drooping head To feast his eyes on my Nellie dancing      there naked on silver sand by the Silver           River for her lover, the Sun. I started to get kind of sore. But I knew the old willow was too old to do any harm, So I chanted:      Do not disturb my very own.      I'll let you stand afar and look      At her whose soul is wine to me,      A golden book, a soothing tone. I saw her warm pert, laughing mouth. I saw her right red lips Magnetic, honey-clewed, half-parted, Uncurtain the tips of her white, white teeth- White like rice in a red-rimmed ebony bowl! I saw her eyes smiling through her long black hair Which hung all loose and lustrous in the Sun-glow. I heard my Nellie say to her lover the Sun: "Come love me now, come love me long." And I saw the Sun run off giggling behind the clouds. Nellie shrugged her shoulders And thrust her fists in her cynical ribs, And leaned slightly forward, And sang with the voice of a low-down hag The song of the Black Fates: "Dark gal born Of a dark, dark woman Ahey! Sho' bound to see dark days." She plunged into the stream and swam against the tide, While I gazed on, wrapt in celestial bliss, wild-eyed.
She is a golden faery child.      Her face is honey-colored, too. She skips about her candy shop,      While sunlight dances through The door . . . . kissing my golden Sue.  She's everything the sun could wish,      If form be everything. If otherwise, then she's a fish;      Her face, a keen warm sting.
In the morning of life We till our soil. We plough and harrow too; There is precious little Time to waste, For at noon-time we are through. In the afternoon We plant our seed For the crop we hope to grow. And the product of The after-years, Is the crop that now we sow. At even-tide We gather in The crop that we have grown. Be it good or evil; Wheat or tare, We reap what we have sown. Then-till and harrow Well your soil. And plant your seed with care; For you reap what you sow In a span of life Sometime, somehow, somewhere.
Last of them all, thou pretty blue blossom, Growing on hill-side and down by the brook, By the long fence row, and close by the road-side      In bright sunny nook. They are all gone, they which were Earth’s adornment.      They are all gone, yes, every one. Sad place the Earth is indeed without flowers      To bask in the sun. But thou art here as it were to give one more      Bright dream of beauty, before Winter strong Sweeps on the Earth and with hard cruel fetters      Will hush the brook’s song. Lifting thy head high up so thy bright star      Will gleam up above the dry stalks and dead grass; Proof, life holds purity, goodness and beauty,      Though all seeming pass. Last of them all, thou pretty blue blossom,      Growing on hill-side, and down by the brook, By the long fence-row, and close by the road-side,      In bright sunny nook. 
I’d rather have the thought of you to       hold against my heart, Than any gift that mortal hands have       power to impart. I'd rather have the dream of you to keep       within my breast, Than any shining dower of gold by for-       tune’s few possessed. Ah, love, no sweeter thing than this I’d       ask to come to me, That I might keep the thought of you       through all eternity. 
After years of blindly groping Through the midst of light we see, Tiring of this useless hoping, We dare to tread this moral sea.  On the verge of a racial abyss, Goaded on by coated words; Hot sparks fly and falling, hiss As our plough shares turn to swords.  Submitting no more as our forefathers Did in time of direst need, Determined, as the great storm gathers, Not a step must we recede.
God knew I'd struggled lone and long, He heard me crying in the night; He knew I was not strong Enough to carry out the fight, So he drew me from the noisy throng; And breathed into my sould a song." 
Yes, I believe in fairies.  I believe in brownies too. Yes, I believein fairies. Because I know they're true. And if you'll learn to love them, They'll come and play with you. 
One sunny Autumn day When I went out to play, An Elf-man in a tree Dropped colored leaves on me.
An endless stretch of blue Flecked with wee silver lights, A luminous, laughing ball Brightening the inky nights. Little brown babies tucked Away in fleecy beds While fleeting, fairy dreams Dance through their drowsy heads. 
After the nights like days, the days like nights, Crowded with movement, filled and overflowing, Whirling like circling birds in aimless flights, Dipping round gilded dome and steepled heights, Blessed is being here and without knowing Or caring of the city’s ways and sights. With peace dearer than love within my breast, Blessed is being here behind the curtain, Blessed to know the meaning of real rest, Where even thought can at its virile best Be sweet, yet no less militant and certain Than a fierce eagle folded in its nest.  Far from the petty troubles of the street, And little men who mouth their little woe, Blessed is being in this strange retreat, Blessed the sleepy hours so long and sweet, That fold me in from life my friend and foe, With kindly bands about my hands and feet.  Like music blown through tropical corn sheaves, Blessed the foreign tongue that soothes and charms, Like golden drops of rain from thick-thatched eaves, That fall into uplifted tania leaves, Blessed disease, the bitter scourge, that warms My chastened spirit that here new hope receives. 
Just as molten thoughts o’erflow    From an unknown fiery source       To form themselves in poetry, Such is the wavering self in woe    Seeking life’s straight or winding course.       To infinity.
When I think of the hosts of little ones Who wake to a birdless dawn, Who know of no meadow that waits for them, No pool with its dragon flies All bathed with the silver of morning light Like the lights that flash on the pool, When I think of that trystless waking today— So far as to meadows and meads, So far as to tossing billows of wheat, So far as to millet tides, So far as to orchards and woods to seek To swing from the kind sweet trees— I fear that the dawn’s too rich for my share. I fear I have robbed some child Of the fragrance of dew, Of the birds’ first notes, Of the warm kind light from God— All sent in tints of nasturtium blooms— For the little red hearts of childhood. 
The Bird in the Cage  This poem received Honorable Mention in The Crisis Prize contest of 1926.  I AM not better than my brother over the way, But he has a bird in the cage and I have not, It beats its little fretted green wings Against the wires of its prison all day long. Backward and forward it leaps, While summer air is tender and the shadows of leaves Rock on the ground, And the earth is cool and heated in spots, And the air from rich herbage rises teeming, And gold of suns spills all around, And birds within the maples And birds upon the oaks fly and sing and flutter. And there is that little green prisoner, Tossing its body forward and up, Backward and forth mechanically! I listen for its hungry little song, Which comes unsatisfying, Like drops of dew dispelled by drought O, rose bud doomed to ripen in a bud vase! O, bird of song within that binding cage! Nay, I am not better than my brother over the way, Only he has a bird in a cage and I have not. 
At the Pool EFFIE LEE NEWSOME  LIKE to stand right still awhile Beside some forest pool. The reeds around it smell so fresh, The waters look so cool! Sometimes I just hop in and wade, And have a lot of fun, Playing with bugs that dart across The water in the sun.  They lodge here at this little pool— All sorts ef bugs and things That hop about its shady banks, Or dart along with wings, Or ‘scamper on the water top, As water-striders go, Or strange back-swimmers upside down, Using their legs to row, Or the stiff, flashing dragon flies, The gentle damoiselle, The clumsy, sturdy water-bugs, And scorpions as well, That come on top to get fresh air From homes beneath the pool, Where water-boatmen have their nooks, On pebbles, as a rule.  And then, behold! Kingfisher comes, That great big royal bird! To him what is the dragon fly That. kept the pool life stirred? Or water-tigers terrible That murder bugs all day? Kingfisher comes, and each of these Would hide itself away!  He swoops and swallows what he will, A stone-fly or a frog. Wing’d things rush frightened through the air, Others to hole and log. The little pool that held them all I watch grow very bare, But fisher knows his hide and seek— He’ll find some one somewhere! 
I just heard your soft smothered voice today ! I’m sure you'll flit on in your lightwinged way, Unmindful, undreaming of me, Who have not yet seen you in blue and brown,  But just heard your lush notes drip down, drip down As showers from the black ash tree. 
When I was very young      Before I'd seen so much of life: Or sought my spurs      Felt a lash Or known a scar      I heard the wise men Of the street say,      "One who has no luck at cards       Has luck at love And visa versa."      But I have tried cards Have played at love–      Sans fortune at either For I have only won      At throwing dice; Of which the wise men      Of the street said, nothing.
Sweetest little t'ing on earth, No one knows how much you's worth!–  Though I know you's worth a lot–  More than any other tot : There's no baby anywhere Is as sweet as you, my dear.  Dearest t'ing a body knows, Sweeter than the sweetest rose In the June-time, in the Spring, Dearer than the dearest t'ing; Matters not who else I see, You's the clearest chil' to me.  Brightest, cutest little eyes Lak the sun in Summer's skies ; Cunnin' little moufe an' nose, Teeth o' pearl, an' cheeks o' rose,– Goodness lan's, you's so complete It's no wonder you's so sweet!  Got a smile so deep an' broad, An' yo' ways jes' one sweet chord; Dearest, I mus' git you tol': You is worth yo' weight in gol'! Sell you! Not far any price!–  You's too dear, too sweet, an' nice.
Today--tomorrow And the day after tomorrow The song of the washboard Is beautiful to her ears And the water makes her hands Clean and white Like the hands of Jesus; The clothes on the line too Are clean and white and beautiful Like the robes of Jesus: Wrinkled old woman-- When Sunday comes  And the minister preaches About the beautiful robes of Jesus She will think about Mrs. Gregory's clothes White and beautiful on the line, White like the robes of Jesus. She will be happy because her hand are clean-- Clean like the hands of Jesus. 
Comparison Dawn-- And the forms of trees Against the sky, Dark trees, Scrawny and earth hardened Like the hands of those who toil. Dawn, Trees, And the hands of my people Stretching upward As they have For ages. Old Things Wine aged in wood, The dusty portrait in the attic, Grandmother's gray hair, Spirituals, (Things old as the earth is old And beautiful as the earth) Old things— Sometimes they are good to hear Or taste Or to look at :More often They are pleasant to think of. Virginia Scenery Mountains that rise Like colossal brown breasts, Skies that bend low, Blue skies That bend low, Sucking from big brown breasts.
There’s sorrow in your face, Old woman, I can plainly see The pain beneath your wrinkled smile That aches incessantly.  There’s a quiver in your speech, Old man, I clearly hear A trembling in your feeble voice, A trembling as from fear.  A daughter fallen by the way, All fond hopes turned to lies, One son in jail— Another, dead, How could you be elsewise? 
Your eyes are bold Like all the stars That blaze in jungle skies. Your lips are sweet Like jungle fruit That no one sells or buys.  Your breast is warm Like tropic noons, Like noons of jungle days. Your voice sounds strange Like all the winds That sing wild jungle lays.  In your embrace There’s strength and joy And God has given thee A flame to fire Thy soul and burn Within incessantly. 
“Behold our son, our valiant dead,”  They say to one another—  And all the while  None ever thinks  That he might be my brother:  But I am glad he holds his peace,  I’m glad he can’t come back;  I'd hate to see Love crucified  If he, by chance, were black. 
The fires of a thousand loves  Burned bright within her  Night and day,  The years like bellows  Fanned the flames  Which ate her heart and soul away. 
Dear Bess, He'll have rings and linen things, And others made of silk; There'll be toys like other boys’ And cream upon his milk;  True, some sort of merit in a mart Where goods are sold for money, But packed with comfort is the heart That shares with you what's funny; So please kiss him when he’s very bad And laugh with him in gladness,— Life is too long a way to go, And age will bring him sadness . . . Pray you for unceasing springs, Swelling deep in pard’n, That into twin lives may grow Time’s unfading garden.
It is dangerous for a woman to defy the gods; To taunt them with the tongue's thin tip, Or strut in the weakness of mere humanity, Or draw a line daring them to cross; The gods who own the searing lightning, The drowning waters, the tormenting fears, The anger of red sins... Oh, but worse still if you mince along timidly- Dodge this way or that, or kneel, or pray, Or be kind, or sweat agony drops, Or lay your quick body over your feeble young, If you have beauty or plainness, if celibate, Or vowed-the gods are Juggernaut, Passing over each of us....    Or this you may do: Lock your heart, then, quietly, And, lest they peer within, Light no lamp when dark comes down Raise no shade for sun, Breathless must your breath come thru, If you'd die and dare deny The gods their god-like fun!
We stand for truth and right We're in to win the fight; God is our King. He loves humanity And will us liberty. He guides us on our way Both night and day.  We are an army strong; We fight for right, not wrong. God lead us on. We'll march to victory; Truth is our sword and shield. Let come what will or may, We're not dismayed.  Truth, right and love will stand The test in any land; God rules on high. So valiant soldiers brave, Triumphant, pave the way. To arm, the sword unsheathe For liberty.
What will the pink man say When this world is no more And a man no longer a man But a spirit impure Waiting at the court of his God To answer for the wrongs He did on the sod? What will the pink man say? What will his proud spirit say When his God should ask him: "How have you treated your brother, Your dark brother Jim?" Will he hang his haughty spirit head Remembering the tree And those that he bled? What will this proud spirit say?
Tragedy  I KNOW of but one tragedy Beside which Death is good: Hands that are carved of ivory Grow stained as cinnamon wood. 
At Dawn  ONLY this perfect night is ours, Only its beauty we possess, Now stillness creeps across the stars And into your kiss my loneliness. 
The Negro in his blindness      Bows down to white men's gods, Content with crumbs of kindness      Or any other odds; Yet once his wits were duller,      Once, weaker his backbone; And at last the man of color      Stirs, and dreams about his own.
What does the Negro want?      What you would want           If you were in his place.           A generous human space, Nor more, nor less. Nor danger nor duress The heart of him shall daunt. Until all men of every race are free, And everywhere all have full right to be.
Damn everybody— White folks push me down Black  ones keep me there—” Then they say, “Keep him there—” But I’ll not be kept—d’ye hear? I’ll win though it take all my years— I'll win. 
O lady of my dreams— In love’s garden I found you, While stars above us shone and Lit our way to love. We wandered in the night among The shadowy trees and dewy scented Flowers Embossed in silver moonlight. The shadows hid us as we Plighted our troth and as loving We did vow eternal faith. Then we were as precious gems Deeply set in A beautiful setting, much as The beauty of the black opal pierces The world with laughing lustre And yet remains serene in the black. Lady of my dreams—in love’s garden I found you,  But with the coming of the morn— The dawn, Then my love I lost you—for The moon was gone.
It was dead winter time Ma feet flat on de groun'. It was dead winter time And ma feet was flat on de groun' A've been all ovah town And no work can be foun'..

1.  As if It were a ball Thrown by children playing The moon rolls down the sky street Gaily, 2. I stand Like a flower Lifted by earth to you My eternal bee who shall drink Me dry. 3 As if It were the rarest wine, I shall drink the bitterness Which I inherit from life And smile. 4. How like A drop of dust Before the wind am I In front of the eternal breath Of God.
How very like a tree Alas am I And like to bursting blossoms Are my thoughts. Some will remain upon the tree And fruit And others fall And drift far on the stream. For those that drift T here shall be no returning; But those which fruit Shall burst and scatter seed. The seed shall stand A flowering tree again Each generation stronger than the last. I'm but the tree! Would I were soil or water. I could not face the agony of death— Eternally to mother tree and seedling And breathe the beauty of the blossom time. Being the tree I needs must face the shedding Bear the fruit which bursts And flowers which fall; Standing helpless see them drift down stream To sea— Where there shall be no coming back! 
(Leaves) Tender green eyes flashing,      To catch the eye of God Thanking him for bounties      Flowing from the sod.  (Branches) Praying arms outstretched      To the silent sky, Penetrating vastness      For a mute reply.  (Body) A brown gnarled vase      Lacquered with bark. The resting place       Of a singing lark.  (Roots) Tiny tripping toes      Pivoted in soil That the swaying body      Never may recoil.  (L’envoi) The dance of leaves is a beautiful thing.      The lyric of branches sweet. The cry of a body bent by the wind      And roots rumbling in retreat. 
Like roses ramble on the ground And up the trellised porch, I have sought you all around Bearing brave the torch.  Now the lengthy search has burned Out the flaming light. I with broken heart return Searching thru the night. 
I turned to the world for silence    But only turmoil kept  The very hills and valleys     Where beauty once had crept. I turned to my heart for silence    I did not find it there, For therein were the tyrants    Sorrow and despair. I turned to my soul for silence--    There like a pensive pool Was silence like a king in state    Calm, serene, and cool. 
Out of the dust, out of the dirt and dust,  Came in the night, came in the darkest of nights, Being with beast, being as beast. Love to beast, love by beast. Night—a whip, a chain, a ship, more whip.  To the land of the free, to the free land.  Existing with beast, existing like beast. Hatred to beast, hated by beast. Dawn—a war, a peace, a freedom, more wars.  To be free, yet not to have freedom. Living with beast, living as beast. Scorn at beast, scorned by beast. Day—the New Negro.
Brown girls that my arms have known, Old loves and better days Come back again to trouble me, Whenever a jazzband plays. Brown girls I had quite forgot With love's first pointed flames Are here again, when the music starts— I even remember names.
All night they whine upon their ropes and boom Against the dock with helpless prows : These little ships that are too worn for sailing Front the wharf but do not rest at all. Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think, No doubt, of China and of bright Bombay. And they remember islands of the East, Formosa, and the mountains of Japan They think of cities, ruined, by the sea And they are restless, sleeping at the wharf. Tugging at the dim, grey wharf they think No less of Africa. An east wind blows And salt spray sweeps the unattended decks. Shouts of dead men break upon the night. The captain calls his crew and they respond The little ships are dreaming—land is near. But mist comes up to dim the copper cast. Mist dissembles images of the trees. The captain and his men alike are lost. And their shouts go down in the rising sound of waves. * * * * *  Ah little ships, I know your weariness I know the sea-green shadows of your dream. For I have loved the cities of the sea, And desolations of the old days I Have loved: I was a wanderer like you And I have broken down before the wind.
Thoughts of death Crowd over my happiness Like dark clouds Over the silver sickle of the moon. Death comes to some Like a grizled gangster Clubbing in the night To some Like an obstinate captain Steadily besieging barriers To some Like a brown adder Lurking in violet speckled underbrush To some Like a gentle nurse Taking their toys and stroking their hot brows. Death will come to you, I think Like an old shrewd gardener Culling his rarest blossom ...
Old Man Buzzard Wid his bal' head Flopped in de fiel' An' eyed young Fred Clacked his beak, an'  Den he said--- "Youse got a plump gal, Roun' an' strong, Promise she'll love you, Woan go wrong. Lemme tell yo', big boy, Cain't las' long. "Buddy on de nex' farm, Good ole frien', Got no dimes, But what he'll len', Friendship fine, But friendship en'--- "Yo' gits good vittels Likes yo' co'n, Ain' been sick Sence yo' was bawn. All sich good luck Soon be gone. "Death comes a-orderin' Folks aroun, Got blacksnake whip Bring yuh down Yo' frien' caint help yo' Nor yo' brown" Fred look up, When he hear dis trash. Grin crack his mouth An' de lightnin' flash, Th'o' back his head An' de thunder crash--- Whoever sent yo' Tell him, say Fred, 'leave frettin' Fo' nother day.' Mistah Bal' head Buzzard, Git away! "Doan give a darn Ef de good things go, Game rooster yit, Still kin crow Somp'n in my heart here Makes me so. "In roas'n ear time A man eats co'n. Dough he knows in winter, Co'ns all gone. Worry's no good To whet teeth on. "No need in frettin' Case good times go Things ez dey happen Jes' is so Nothin' las' always Farz I know. . . ."
She hath a tinted aura all about her pretty head And all her thoughts are gentle sighs to soothe the wide world's wound: The golden glow of sunset is ensconced about her for, Her gown of dawn and dusk hue is the fairest ever found.  Sunlight she knows, but dawn and dusk are periods which she loves And through the August evenings while we hear her gentle croon The world without is Beauty and the world within is Joy. And she seals her song with kisses and the graces of a rune 
(An Impression of Tampa) REVERENCE and wonder And mild surprise Shall reveal my city To human eyes. The sea and the shore And the lone lagoon Shall show our beauty And our boon. And rising there In spiral waves The created wonder Of our days The Temple of Florence Our pride and joy Born at first In the dream of a boy. Our city And our dream Consummated Beam on beam. 
The folks are awaiting and I must go The doors behind are locked; the driver waits. Anticipation begins and murmurs low Come swelling up to me from behind the gates. The horses are poised as if to make a plunge The groom stands ready who cared for them. All hearts are tuned for journeying: the joyous lunge Into the twinkling town where dwells Meristem.  We pass into the distance and fade away Travellers in Time, who despite our cares and woes Promise to return some later, fairer day When fewer vexations cross our path; who knows’ Our ways are strewn with many an unknown turn And only he who goes along may learn.
The Law that spins these toy-top worlds in space, Divides the opaque darkness from the day, Directs the shining of each solar ray, Guides and controls the stellar chariot race, And holds the whirling universe in place— Altho no particle may stop or stay— This Law immutable, you may not sway, Or modify, or alter by your grace . . . Unfailingly the tides of ocean flow, The giant oaks and modest pansies grow, Inexorably following the deed Comes, without haste and without pause, the meed. A tiny tendril creviced in the rock In time mill burst apart a granite block.
Three centuries beneath your haughty heel, Humble and ignorant, debased and poor, Like mendicants before your temple-door, The potentates of earth have seen us kneel. With guileless art we made our mute appeal, And tho' you scorned and spurned us, tried the more To love and serve you better than before. Your children we have nursed, your daily meal Set forth, your crops have reaped, your acres tilled, Your burdens borne, your enemies have killed; We've given of our brawn unstintingly, And of our brain, when so you'd let it be. Remembering all, how can you lynch and hate, And with our quivering clay, your passion sate?
Her eyes were hard And his bitter As they sat and watched  The fire fade From the ashes of their love. Then they turned  And saw the naked autumn wind Shake the bare autumn trees, And each one thought As the cold came in-- ........"It might have been"........
How like the restless beating Of our hearts Is the surge of the sea; How like the tumult Of our souls Is the lashing of the storm; How like the yearning In our song Is the wind, How like a prayer Is night.
A mountain Is earth's mouth . . . She thrusts her lovely Sun painted lips To the clouds . . . for heaven's kiss. A tree Is earth's soul . . . She raises her verdant Joyous prayer To the slowly sinking sun And to evening's dew. She flings her rugged defiance To hell's grumbling wrath And deadly smile; Then rustles her thanksgiving To the dawn. A river Is earth's tears . . . Flowing from her deep brown bosom To the horizon of Oblivion . . . O! Earth, why do you weep? 
I saw a dark boy      Trudging on the road (Twas’ a dreary road Blacker than night).      Oft times he'd stumble And stagger 'neath his burden      But still he kept trudging Along that dreary road.  I heard a dark boy      Singing as he passed Oft times he'd laugh      But still a tear Crept thru his song,      As he kept trudging Along that weary road .  I saw a long white mist roll down      And cover all the earth (There wasn't even a shadow      To tell it was night). And then there came an echo . . . .  . . . . Footsteps of a dark boy Still climbing on the way.  A song with its tear      And then a prayer From the lips of a dark boy      Struggling thru the fog. Oft times I'd hear       The lashing of a whip And then a voice would cry to heaven      “Lord! . . . Lord!      Have mercy! . . . . mercy!” And still that bleeding body      Pushed onward thru the fog . Song . . . . Tears . . . . Blood . . . . Prayer      Throbbing thru the mist.  The mist rolled by      And the sun shone fair, Fair and golden      On a dark boy . . . . cold and still High on a bare bleak tree      His face upturned to heaven His soul upraised in song      “Peace. . . . Peace      Rest in the Lord.”  Oft times in the twilight      I can hear him still singing As he walks in the heavens,      A song without a tear A prayer without a plea.  Lord, lift me up to the purple sky      That lays its hand of stars Tenderly on my bowed head      As I kneel high on this barren hill. My song holds naught but tears      My prayer is but a plea Lord take me to the clouds      To sleep . . . to sleep. 
I want to take down with my hands The silver stars That grow in heaven's dark blue meadows And bury my face in them.  I want to wrap all around me The silver shedding of the moon To keep me warm.  I want to sell my soul To the wind in a song To keep me from crying in the night.  I want to wake and find That I have slept the day away, Only nights are kind now . . .  With the stars . . . moons . . . winds and me . . .  
These men were kings albeit they were black:    Toussaint and Dessalines and L'Ouverture; Their majesty has made me turn my back    Upon a plaint I once shaped to endure. These men were black, I say, but they were crowned    And purple-clad, however brief their time. Stifle your agony, let grief be drowned;    We know joy had a day once and a clime. Dark gutter snipe, black sprawler-in-the-mud,    A thing men did a man may do again; What answer filters through your sluggish blood    To these dark ghosts who knew so bright a reign? "Lo, I am dark, but comely," Sheba sings;    "And we were black," three shades reply, "but kings." 
Old Man Death, Keeps comin' roun'. Dat Ole Man Death, Keeps comin' roun'. Last time he came He laid ma mother down. Each black wagon On de line, O Lawd, pity Dis heart o' mine! Old Man Death, Keeps comin' roun'. Dat Ole Man Death. Keeps comin' roun'. Last time he came He laid ma mother down. Two white horses Wid eight black feet, Carried dat hearse Down de street.

Old Man Death, Keeps comin' roun'. Dat Ole Man Death, Keeps comin' roun'. Last time he came He laid ma mother down. 
Ah left ma mother's home Jess to be wid him. Ah qit ma mother's home So ah could be wid him. An' now de Prison Man Done took ma poor man Jim. Forty years is what dey gave him An' forty years is so long, A forty years in de jail house An' forty years is so long, Why in forty years of time De bes' gal can go wrong. Hard luck, hard luck, Hard luck as Ah can be. Say hard luck, hard luck Ah'm hard luck as Ah can be. Had'nt had dis man a year When de law took him from me. Ah'd go drown maself, But de water looks so cold. Say Ah'd go an' drown maself, But de river looks so cold. What good can a man be Dat's seventy-two years old? If Ah had a sharp, sharp knife An' Ah knew it would'nt hurt, If Ah had a real sharp knife Dat Ah knew it would'nt hurt, Ah'd cut ma head right off An' bury it beneaf de durt. But a person dat's dead Stays dead so long, Ah say a person dat's dead Has to stay dead so long. Ah guess Ah'll git a laundry job An' sing de Jail Blues Song.
Headlines in de papers, Lou done killed her man. Headlines in de papers, Lou done killed her man. Court room was silent, When de trail began. De lawyers talked an' talked, Dey tried to save her. Dey talked an' talked an' talked, Dey tried to save her. A bad name was all, De witness gave her. Then Lou said, "Mister Judge, 'Ain't sorry he's dead. Say Lou said, "Mister Judge, 'Ain't sorry he's dead. Wish someone else had Hit him on his head." Oh, de Jury went out, An' never came back. Oh, de Jury went out, An' never came back. Thought I saw po' Lou, Ridin' in her hack. De Judge said, "Sister Lou, Gonna turn you free. Sister Lou," said de Judge, "Gonna turn you free. First gal I've seen who Tol' de truth to me." 
Once Bad Gal Ah was a good gal Before Ah struck dis town, Ah was a good, good gal Before Ah struck dis town, But men an' liquor Drag you down. A good, good gal Just bad once, Ah'm a good good gal Just bad once--- When a handsome man Made me his dunce. Ah'd go straight if Ah thought Ah could, Say Ah'd go straight If Ah thought Ah could, But a once bad gal Can't never be good.
If I had dug in one place all my life, say all my life, I would have dug a hole Through dis earth, say through dis earth. I would have dug a hole through dis earth. Eigh! Lawd! If I had dug in one place all my life, say all my life, I would be a-tumbling down in space, say down in space. I would be a-tumbling down in space. Eigh! Lawd! 
Smooth black man of mine 'Aint nobody but you. No matter where you go Or what you do I could'nt say we're through. Honest Daddy, 'Aint nobody but you.
Last time they saw her She was down by the river Lawdy, Lawd, Please forgive her. Gamblers got her man And beat him dead. Gamblers broke a chair Across his head. Lawdy, Lawd, Please forgive her, She's gone to sleep Beneaf the river.
These of the coal-black faces Confide, low-voiced, Fisherman, washerwoman, Quietly shutting themselves off From the pool-room loafers. Unbroken By the salt spume of the sea, Tight-lipped against the whispering fears of age, He holds her laughing. In his keen eyes The gleam of one who knows he must endure All shifting winds, And hate Of deep-embittered sons of slaving race, Must outreach The hunger of insatiate women, And broken nets at sea. Her brave face Softens in a smile  And light of youth's long hopes and passion Sunk away. But she has seasoned in her proper time And grown to mellow laughter. Strong, Like some far runner turning with new vigor Home. Now she is firm Against the tearings of untimely births, And sweating steam of clothes; Firm now, at last, Against the pleading smiles Of brutal, melancholy, Rich-voiced men. 
Physician The patients who loved you, And the hope work brought, Sustained you,  When, worn out by late vigils With the sick, poor and black, You had to crawl On hands and knees To those who trusted you, Alone.  Physician  You find real pleasure in your work— Taking liberties when you examine women, And joking about it later.  You prosper By prescribing dope to the slum Negroes For medicine, And taking their money with no serious effort to help them.  When you have made your “pile”, You will move as far away from the Negro section As you can go.  Minister  You have something in you Which has made you feel the Church A bigger thing than yourself,— A Baptist church,— And which has made you go months without salary, So that the Church might be saved;  Something Which has made your talk Like a friend’s silent confidence, And your face unlike other men’s, And made even your wife Respect you.  Do you wish to call it “God”? I know you will speak it quietly.  Minister  You make your living By talking through a service  About God, And rejoice equally To get a marriage or  A funeral.  Have you convinced yourself yet That this whole business of a church  And confident speaking to God, with you leading,  Is not a madman’s game?  And aren’t they fools to be paying you a salary  To speak to God for them, When your thoughts are always Of a pretty wife And a larger church?  Lawyer  You brought home your northern education To bleed the poor “n*****s” you scorn, Threatening frantic blacks with jail, And pretending to save them from The Bugaboo of the Law. From one love-blind mother, You boast, You got all she had, Three hundred dollars, To keep her son out of jail.  Well, Your new car Is all you have, And in that your white-skinned wife Loves her college boy;  While the stupid, black mother You broke, Scrubs floors to keep Her son.  College Girl  You spent every week-end In all-night liquor parties with your “man”; You spent the money your mother Feared to borrow on her home, Not on books, but on dresses To make you the belle of fraternity dances.  And you didn’t learn a damned thing Except the unnecessary tricks of loving, And ten animalistic dances.  You will teach the Negro students farther south What you learned.   Northern - College Girl  The chief thing You learned from your northern training Was how to be a sycophant with men, And excuse your parasitism By calling it love.  Now you teach high school in the week, And wisely go to your “man” out of town For the week-ends.  I pity you. I know how often you’ve wished You were dead, When you faced Your mother, After those week-ends.  College Athlete  You spend your winters Juggling basket-balls And women. You won’t work, You won't study, You won’t marry;  But you have four “letters”, And a fraternity pin.  College education Of a hundred like you every year Will bring the race along rapidly. 
The Leader One lone bird, Small and brown, Singing in the morning One clear note,  Singing to the high church-steeple With its needle spire Pointing to the infinite heaven, Merging with the far blue sky,  In the fresh vigor of the morning His one clear call, Harsh, unvarying, but Beautiful.  Oh, all sweeter, fuller singers, All loud and busy noises of the mid-day Drown his voice;  But in the quiet cool of dusk, By the spire pointing to the far blue vault, I hear him singing still,  Lonely With his one unfaltering call, Beautiful With his one clear note Following the spire.  Fighters These of the coal-black faces Confide low-voiced,— Fisherman, washerwoman, Quietly shutting themselves off From the pool-room loafers.  Unbroken By the salt spume of the sea, Tight-lipped against the whispering fears of age, He holds her laughing,  In his keen eyes the gleam of one who knows He must endure all shifting winds, and hate Of deep-embittered sons of slaving race, Must outreach The hunger of insatiate women, And broken nets at sea.  Her brave face Softens with a smile, And light of youth’s long hopes and passion, Sunk away;—  But she has seasoned in her proper time And grown to mellow laughter, Strong Like some far runner turning with new vigor Home.  Now she is firm against The tearings of untimely births, And sweating steam of clothes; Firm now, at last, against The pleading smiles Of brutal melancholy, Rich-voiced men.  To All Negroes Everywhere I know lone dwellers on a barren farm, Who daily drink from acrid waters, rank With yellow scum and sickening taste,— Minerals from the dark, deep-hidden earth.  This bitterness they change for health and power, And stomachs sweetened to their vulgar food, And now no longer wish A long draught from the cold, sweet well. 
Listen  The moon is whispering  		Baby  	          My baby        My black baby The moon is whispering to you  	“Come and take me baby” 	Fondle me with little fingers  	Kiss me with sugar lips 	“I was made for such as you, baby.”  Listen  The wind is whispering  Baby  	          My baby  	  My soft baby’s body The wind is whispering to you  	“I will go through all the world, baby 	I will bring the gold of rich perfumes 	I will weave a garment of strange harmonies 	I will bring all to you, baby.”  Listen  The whole night is whispering  Baby  	          My baby   My soft baby’s body The whole night is whispering to you  	“A blanket of black silk for your crib, baby 	A blanket of silk embroidered with stars 	The sky for your blanket, the world for your crib 	The night for your nurse-maid, baby.”  		The moon 		The wind  		The night  		Whisper, baby 	      Whisper your lullaby  
They watched her glide across the stage, Each one poised with breath a tip- toe, Felt his soul strings link with hers, Loosed his heart and let it go To her brown and tapering fingers, Crushing it into a ball, Throwing it with accuracy, Smiling as she saw it fall. Bending willow-like to music, As a bird in willows, singing Of a love that's so much fancy From a dream marsh ever springing. "Art," the critic said next day, And people flocked to see her play. Laid their fair hearts at her feet– But never saw her on the street. 
“Hey there, Bub! I say!” Silence. (“He knows my name.’’) “Hey George! This way!” Silence. (“Same, old, game.”) “Hey, darky! You!!” Silence. (“Same, old game.” ) “T’ll be damned if tain’t true! Nigger showing off, posing offense At a name. Do you think I’d ‘Mister’ you! Black beast! Any name For you'd be an honor. Who Looks at you, sees a cringing, tame  Beast. Intelligence! Bah! Blunt as pig iron. Black soul! What’s in you to respect! Ha! Ha! I could take the whole Of your race and dam the oceans with its refuse! Stinking flotsam! Black beast! God! Who has use For your carcass!”  So, at least, Was this white man’s thought.  But out of this stinking flotsam, God Wrought a young knighthood. Sworn to their vows, with flashing sword And dazzling shield, they stood— A new order of Negro Youth, eager For the quest of the Guarded Heights, God bade them, “Go forward! No meager Whims of men shall put to flight Your soul’s great force. Wear My favors, Vision and Love. Evil shall glower, a few shall dare To mock; but steadfast above All pettiness, you shall stand.  “New Negro, sing your soul's own song, Holy, majestic, grand. Your notes shall lead a jeering throng From baseness to nobility. Dip your gilt-edged pen in the wellspring Of your heart. With swift agility, Fling word on word to pierce and sting As the rapier thrust, men’s hearts. Your daring pen shall slowly lessen Studied, insidious plots Of prejudice and inhuman oppression. Open the flood-gate of your vivid soul. On crested waves of creative Genius, unveiled beauty shall roll Forth, to transform, to give New life to barren canvass. Men Shall gaze astounded and their Eager hands shall reach out then, Not to despoil, but to share, To possess the lofty inspiration Pure art alone can give.  “New Negro, in this generation You shall fully live. ‘The old order changeth’. Not Mold of face, nor color of skin Shall conquer the cruel heart Of race tyranny, or bigotry, its kin. They shall perish by your flashing sword Of ability. Your shield, brightly  Emblazoned with fine achievement, shall afford Invulnerable armor for unsightly Barbs of asinine abuse. Knights Of the order of New Negro Youth, You shall reach the Guarded Heights  With weapons of integrity and truth.” 
Lord, keep my soul from bitterness and sting, My heart from searing scorch and crushing blight; I would not, by my gloom, obscure the light Which might illumine rocks where others cling. Far better, Lord, my eager hands should bring Some little gift with my heart's blood a-dight, To this great good. Ere I shall merge in night, Let me not grovel, Lord, aloft, I'd sing. For those who stand with twisted fear-clenched hands, And heart's red chalice brimming full of hate, See life's gold gates swing open far too late, And peace go streaming by with hurried stare. Far better 'twere to face the hoarse-voiced crowd, And hoist love's guidon in the turgid air.
The memory of you is slight in my mind, But poignant. Like a sole, unrepeated experience, Like the wheeling flight of a gull, Like smoke hanging high in the blue In vaporish traceries,— Without sound, but significant As a thunder-preceding lull. Once I remember glimpsing A column of sand-pipers Marching meticulously Over the sedge-strewn floor of the beach; Slight and graceful, unswerving As war-going fifers; Persistent, purposeful, sure,— And just beyond reach! Easily, far too easily That picture fades from my senses; Yet if once I recall it There springs to my mind perfection; Perfection of sky and sun And ocean and weather Promised fulfilment, of yearning, Assurance of heaven's protection. So you. The memory of you Is slight but poignant; Yet once you enter my mind For the moment you sever All my connection with paltriness, Actions ignoble; Leaving me peace and completeness.— Remain with me ever!
Sing on, O Son of Africa's soil. Let her music touch the world, Make it feel her warm sunshine 'Til it melts their voices into thine.  Your songs burn with a fervent heat, I even hear the tom-tom beat, I see the palm trees swaying there And smell the balmy tropic air.  God has giv'n this song to you So let it ring the whole world through 'Til every soul shall hear and see Africa's glory expressed in thee.
Red and white and yellow flowers    Snuggled close in a jar. Red and white and yellow flowers    Don't know what color they are. Red and white and yellow people    Can't snuggle close in a jar; Red and white and yellow people    Know what color they are.
He gazed awed and mute As she wiggled her body To the tune of a flute. Down her bare back Dark tresses fell She danced like a demon On hot coals of hell. She covered her body In a veil of pale hue Because it was black It shone right through. "Dance on," he cried. "Dance on, fool, To your black feet Hot coals'll feel cool."
God made them very beautiful, the trees: He spoke and gnarled of bole or silken sleek They grew; majestic browed or very meek; Huge-bodied, slim; sedate and full of glees. And He had pleasure deep in all of these. And to them, soft and little tongues to speak Of Him to us, He gave; wherefore they seek From dawn to dawn to bring us to our knees. * * * * Yet here amid the wistful sounds of leaves, A black-hued grewsome something swings and swings Laughter it knew and joy in little things, Till man's hate ended all. —And so man weaves. And God, how slow, how very slow weaves He— Was Christ Himself not nailed to a tree?
I draw the purple folds of iniquity about me And lay me down in the golden shadow of His Word As upon a couch of many cushions. . . . And the vanity of my heart Is as gall upon my lips. Yet is my sinfulness before me Even as the vision of my looking. . . . And though I humble my voice to pour forth Praise and thanksgiving into His Presence, Yet do my feet hunger for the paths of wrongdoing. . . . And my fingers for the softness of evil. . . . And I am like the black stone That is neither fuel nor rock, Anxious to add glowing to the burning Fire, Yet made to feel the rushing of cool waters over its darkness. . . . And I am like the bird born with cripple wing- Longing to fly . . . yet knowing only the pulling of lush grasses At its foot. . . . And there is no contentment in me— Neither in the ways of wrongdoing Nor in the sanctity of Righteousness. . . . 
Within my pulses beat a thousand dawns. Flushed with the fire of jungles; pride of a race Begotten of dark chieftains, lithe with the grace Of somber jungle-trees; doomed to be pawns Of defter, shrewder peoples than they were. Joy in a heritage of color and flame, Dancing and song that death can never claim,— All these within my pulses beat and stir And mingle with an ominous intent, Born out of distant silence, from the heart Of that far shrewder people arrogant, And cooly sure, who play the kingly part. I saw a malamute, once, strain and cry Between the pack and team. Lo, it was I.

Ma old time daddy Came back home last night. His face was pale an' His eyes didn't look just right. He says to me I'm Comin' home to you So sick an' lonesome I don't know what to do. O, men treats women Just like a pair o' shoes. Like a pair o' shoes, I say treats women Like a pair of shoes,--- They kicks 'em round an' Does 'em like they choose. I looked at ma daddy,--- Lawd ! an' I wanted to cry. He looked so thin, Lawd ! that I wanted to cry. But de devil told me    Damn a lover    Comes home to die!
He was somewhat like Ariel    And somewhat like Puck And somewhat like a gutter boy    Who loves to play in muck. He had something of Bacchus    And something of Pan And a way with women    Like a sailor man. He was straight and slender    And solid with strength And lovely as a young tree    All his virile length. He couldn't have been a good man,    All shut up in a cell, 'Cause he'd "rather be a sinner,"    He said,—"and go to hell." 
The dream is vague And all confused With dice and women And jazz and booze. The dream is vague, Without a name, Yet warm and wavering And sharp as flame,— And the loss of the dream Leaves nothing the same. 
She has a lover far away    In some palm-covered street And, more than any other thing    To her, his lips are sweet. She dances now in rue Pigalle    With brown legs bare and slim,— And every kiss of foreign mouths    Brings thoughts of him. Yet when the lights in cabarets    Are cynical and cold, She trades a cheaply perfumed love    For coins of gold.
Something for each of us Surely somewhere, Something the soul needs infinitely there. So press through the dark Through the gloom, through the rain Life holds a balm For each ravishing pain.  Something for each of us! Do not despair— There’s a heart to your answering Fully—somewhere. Press on through the dark With a smile on your face— The something you long for Awaits your embrace. 
For all the woes my life may hold Of hurts and scars and sorrows The blighting bivouac of today, The opal-hued tomorrows, I sum—and hold full paltry pay To offer for the hour That brought to bloom within my heart Love’s one immortal flower! 
At last I gaze into your eyes and know The tryst is kept I held against the years With dire misgivings and with secret fears Lest you be late, too late: time travels slow When lovers wait. The evening sun is low—  The kindly earth an autumn garment wears  All brown and golden, as a friend who shares  The others’ fortune, in its ebb and flow.  Drunk with belated rapture hand in hand At length together, as-I dreamed, we stand, I hear the beating of your heart, and feel The wordless messages it would reveal; At last I gaze into your eyes and see The perfect answer to the call in me. 
I'm awake, I'm away! I have jewels in trust, They are rights of the soul That are holy and just; There are deeds to be done, There are goals to be won, I am stripped for the race In the glare of the sun. I am throbbing with faith, I can! And I must! My forehead to God— My feet in the dust.
The happy woman never cares For flaming tournaments. She wears  A fine contentment, and her hours Are fragrant. Like sequestered flowers Far from the fickle, fevered throng, Her seasons glide to inward song; Her lips are never firmly prest O'er still-born longings unexprest.
I'll not return to Fortune's wheel, She is a Jade! And laughs to scorn the trust I held, The promises she made: But pass on down the boulevard With others—debonaire— I wonder if it's very hard— This seeming not to care?
Tomorrow! As a mocking skull, Come if you will; Today was mine, And in its shine I did distill Full meed of joy All fadeless, pure, Through life's bleak changes to endure: And as I thread the dim-lit way Festooned by sorrow, I bear the smile of yesterday Into tomorrow!
I look and that I see appeals to me As does the manger Babe to Christian man, For she who mothered long another’s brood Upon her lap in rapture holds a child That came from deep travail to claim her love.  Upon its lips she prints a deathless kiss And holds against her breast its trembling form  And through the night she croons a strange old song That tells the world, “Behold, I have my own.”  For she is mother now, that once was such A cruel world with jibes derided her And asked her, “Where are those you brought to light? Where all those hopes you said were yours to give?”  I hear this turbaned mother plead, “O world,  My hopes have shaped themselves in flesh o’ brown And all my deeds have given light to eyes That grasp its infant hour of wonderment. Take now my suckling, let it live for thee And when its manhood breaks its spirit’s bound It shall defend thee, succour thee and love The good that through the ages thou hast served.”  And when the child in sleep would close its eyes This strong young mother lifts with tenderness This proselyte to all the joys and woes An ancient world would give to test its own And lays it snug within its trundle bed And lets the moonlight play upon its form. 
New York with her "hustle," Her "hurry" and "bustle,"' The "Horrid Old Subway" and "El," Her "Miserable housing," Her "Midnight carousing" And "Everyone headed for h–l," Is better than Russia, Or Hindu, or Chin, And in spite of it all, I'll be d–d There is nobody leaving, Those away are grieving, They want to come back and be jammed!
The thorns in love's garden      How they do stick ! As we gather the roses      The thorns will prick. All roses have thorns      Some have only one. It pricks ! in a moment      The hurt is done. Oft' the rose we have given      The most tender care Will bid us know      The thorn is there. Roses and thorns grow      Not far apart, They each have a place      In the human heart. Then know while inhaling      Its fragrance at morn; Though sweet, and I love you,      A rose has a thorn.
He cometh, our hero, in silence that wraps him,    Honored, in exile he suffered and died. The loved Stars and Stripes now in memory o'ercaps him,    Which long he had served with the patriot's pride. We bless him, the man of unselfish devotion,    A martyr to hatred and vicious intrigue Unfolding base schemes to def eat his promotion    For those with the force of oppression in league. We laud him, the layman of soul and of vision,    Of moral persuasion and courage innate. Who conquered himself by a noble decision    And showed us the way to be mighty and great. We mourn him, the Bronze Knight, in solemnized splendor,    Who braved the fierce storms of a warrior's life; A gallant West-Pointer--no idle pretender.    He stood the stern mettle-test, trained for the strife. We cover our Colonel with flags and with flowers    And lay him to rest where his comrades are lain; His sculptured memorial in Arlington towers,    A "Soldier of Fortune," by Fate's arrow slain. We bury our idol with love's veneration,    On his valiant dust let the myrtle e'er bloom. He's earned the respect of a Race and a Nation,    Who voice his rare virtues and weep o'er his tomb. 
Speak kindly of her, who was kind to all,    Whose genial presence is with us no more; Far o'er the vale I hear her spirit call,    And see the Ghost-ship speeding from the shore. She spent her life in service to her kind,    Inspiring Youth each worthwhile task to try, Making them strong in body, firm in mind,    And by example held their standard high. Four-square and upright to the winds she stood,    And nobly fought the problems of her Race; Her kindly nature, sterling motherhood    She gave-a heritage to Time and Place. Her soul up-rising throws an earthward glance And still we hear her call, "Advance! Advance!"
Soul of the brave, beside thy tomb we pause    To voice thy praise at thy centenary Lincoln's right hand in Freedom's flowering cause,    Which raised a nation out of slavery; In the dark hour the people looked to thee,    When North and South in bloody conflict clashed. Thou delt'st the blow that crushed the conquering Lee    As a huge wave against a cliff is dashed, Magnanimous in triumph--nobly scored,    And won the highest honor of the state. Thine act of chivalry redeemed the sword,    A man of sympathy, sublimely great. Today thy name in loving praise we chant,    A nation's idol--the immortal Grant.
A gilded dome that lifts into the sky    Reared from its rugged base on Beacon Hill;    It tops the heights where freedom's airs distill; Beneath its wings immortal relics lie. They tell of brave men who for us did die.    Who fought and conquered with unwavering will    Thrice armed with righteousness, they drank their fill Of freedom's wine, and held her honor high. Here rest their laurels in the Hall of Fame    Where time rewards great deeds with gratitude,    Where free men, sons of freedom's noble brood Assemble, their proud heritage to claim.    Here soars the eagle in its glorious flight,    Emblem of justice, liberty and light.
While Satan plied his whip and held the rein,    And knaves and tyrants ruled the market-place,    There gloating o'er the miseries of a race Trading in human flesh for private gain; He heard the moans of slvaes to heaven ascend    And saw men prostrate, wreathed in grime and mud;    It made the Moon in agony wring blood And caused his heart to melt, his breast to rend. He wept to see the country that he loved    Cursed with disease, slow-dying at the core,    To see hounds fattening on the human gore And his revolting soul with ,pity moved.    He caught the vision of a brighter day     And like a flaming meteor blazed the way. 
Belle Mam'selle of Martinique, Tell us why your dainty feet Trip so blithe the Elysees, How your rainbow turban lies, Framing eyes of wild surprise, Archly twinkling as you sway Down the famous Elysees. Belle Mam'selle of Martinique, Do not show improper pique, Daughter of the tropic shore, Where the winds and sun restore Color to the Nordic cheek,— You are a maiden, quite unique, Petite girl of Martinique. Golden colored nymph are you, Golden maid, whose eyes are dew, Golden colors; copper, bronze, Mango, almond, olive, orange. Roguish maiden, picturesque,— You're a human arabesque,— Sweet coquette, demurely meek, Belle Mam'selle of Martinique!
Out in the night, I hear a liquid note,      I pause and listen, as it sweeter grows; It is a singer with a golden throat,       And heart in which the fire of genius glows. I hear him singing in the twilight hush–      Caroling songs that warm the heart like sweet wine:  No sweet-voiced nightingale or hermit-thrush      Could thrill the world with music more divine.  Though young in year, he sings as one whose heart       Has sung for ages. Yet he wears his crown,  So modestly that men, thrilled by his art,       Pay tribute and forget that his face is brown.  Unselfishly, his soul seeks to inspire       In other souls, divine poetic fire. 
An old brown man with snaky eyes That scintillate and hypnotize-- Serpent-charmer of his race, With thick red lips, shiny face, Frayed frock-coat, stove-pipe hat, Green spectacles, red cravat, Old umbrella, rusty grip Filled with roots and herbs to sip-- He can cast an evil spell, Make you sick or make you well; He can make a hoodoo charm To bring good luck and shield you from harm; Can bring you lover back again, And make your rival writhe in pain-- He's a master of black art, And can poison to the heart, Like a cat on stealthy feet, He comes gliding down the street; People call him, "Doctor Dan"-- He's the snake-eyed conjure man. 
As flower dust is driven down the wind To touch and quicken the green life of earth, As birds spread wings and leave cold lands ‘behind, For regions of sweet warmth and singing mirth: So shall thy thought be carried surely forth To the remotest dwellings of mankind, Reaching its inmost self to give new birth, New strength, new purpose to man’s boundless mind.  The birds of time shall wing thee down the ways Of man’s abode. Thy progress will be keen Against the heavy mist of stormy days, As ever progress through the years has been. Even as strong-winged messengers are seen, In these amazing times with fine amaze, Threading the tides of space that roll between The earth and heavens that ever hold man’s gaze.  The nations will be stricken at thy word, And grand old prejudices crumble down, That ancient pride in warring breasts has stirred. The noblest men shall work for any renown. Thy truest heralds do not fear the frown Of legioned bigots leagued by fear and spurred To crush thy truth, but more the shouting clown, The standard-flocking of the sheeplike herd. 
Midnight thoughts are the mouse that gnaws all night; Starts up strange sounds, when all stilly sounds subside; Ever bolder, bolder grows his gnawing by night To bore into oak wood a tight passage To lead to some eery darker nook. I gnaw tonight on life's deep mystery While slumberers sleep, a sound, a sweet sleep. My life is wood I strive to split, to splinter To gnaw through all stubborn resistance a way To the next room, darker and more mysterious. I must whip up my heart while thoughts gnaw on,- Thoughts that never weary of gnawing gnawing· Mouse-like, they may eat through to find some food In a spacious, sweet-smelling chamber. Midnight thoughts are the mouse that gnaws all night. I woidd from them scurry and flee away So weary I of thoughts that gnaw all night.
‘Tis not the parting That means so much. Ah! No!— It is the frequent After meetings That carry The deeper sting.  When your eyes meet mine (Those eyes once full of love) In a chilling stare— When your lips say A curt “good day” (Those lips that once clung to mine)— When your arms (That held me once in such a tight embrace) Are raised now Only to tip your hat Or for formal handshakes— When we meet again At the old trysting places Among the old Familiar scenes And cannot recall Even by a glance The sweet memories That flock about us As bees about honey—  Ah! these! These Hold the deeper sting! 
I pray that God will grant you these, Faith . . . That holds like roots of trees, Patience . . .  Like a hive of bees, I pray that God will grant you these. I pray that God will grant you these, Strength . . .  For hardships . . . and for ease, A will . . .  As strong as seven seas, I pray that God will grant you these. I pray that God will grant you these, The things that live When beauty flees: The stabler graces . . .  Roots of trees . . .  I pray that God will grant you these. 
You and I At the Feast of Death, When bidden by our unseen host Will lift a common tankard high; Yes . . . you and I, We who are parted 'most In breathless words Will then exchange a toast. Our mutual fates We who are parted, most We'll drink it dry, You and I . . . * * * Arm in arm We'll walk an endless aisle When beckoned my The Great High Priest, You and I Who love each other least. Will kneel confessing all our sins, And while the heavenly organ Plays a solemn tune, Absolved . . . forgiven, Together we will commune And pledge ourselves To lasting unity Before the altar of Eternity. * * * And the silent streets, Unhoused by clan or caste, Will hold two people Gazing on a smouldering past. Our worldly idols Shall be broken down at last    We will not stoop    To build them up again,    Gods of brass    Are Gods of mortal men;    We will be brothers    Breathing spirit breath,    You and I    At the Feast of Death.
They have bruised your body And nailed it to a cross— I saw a black Madonna Weeping for you On a tenement doorstep. Midnight You are a throbbing heart Of stone— The feet of lovers Echo on your sidewalks Like the ticking Of a thousand clocks. Skyscraper It is easy to forget In Harlem— The skyscrapers are motherly fingers  Pointing to something  Afar off. Street Corner This is the rendezvous Of dreamers— What if the cop does tell them To move along: There is a joint up the street Where coffee and buns sell for a dime, And somewhere There are soft dream beds Waiting—  Stars Heaven stoops down To kiss the rooftops Of Harlem Rent is cheaper Up nearer the stars. 
Bravely, we bade farewell to the old      And entered the trend of the new;  Never to falter, faint or fail,       Upward and onward, steady and true.  Though at times the path be dim,      Hatred and malice pierce the soul,  We stand with not a shred of fear,      Facing the new, "warriors bold."  Peace on earth, good will toward men,       Should be a beacon light,  A welcome warmth in every heart,      Piercing the gloom like a ray in the night. Shall we revive the "Golden Rule"       That long since has grown cold, And let the cup of bitterness      Be relics of the old? 
Come out, young men, To guard our gold, To guard our gold,  And watch our land........ They wait to hear No second call-- These gay young men, These brave young men........ And flinging taunts  At crafty Death, They play with him As in a game. And if they lose,  As lose they must, In some queer land, On queerer field, We'll write their names In virgin gold Though rare it be, And dear it be-- And we will give  Our greentest land To hold their dust........ Come out, young men, To guard our gold!
What did they mean, Ten years ago, When they blessed him And sent him forth To kill?  The Bishop's words Come back : The "enemy must be Crushed!"  Today he killed again, Crushed his enemy– Why now their pious horror ? What did they mean, Ten years ago? 
Though you point out our lowly birth And boast your finer, nobler earth, You do not cite, to prove your worth, That you sprang from a Nordic serf.
Mellow notes, Fluted  Vibrant with the echoes of an old forgotten song; Sweet and low, Swinging so, Breaking forth like summer winds that gaily sweep along.  Harmony, Melody Blending like the colours of the rosy-fingered dawn, Measured time, Tones sublime Gentle as an April shower pattering on a lawn.  Bass alone, A swelling moan, “All you little chillen bettah git on bo’d!” “Bye and bye, B’yon’ de sky, Ise sholy gwine a lay down mah heavy, heavy load.”  Smiles and tears, Hopes and fears, “Lawd ha’ mercy on me an’ I hope I'll jine de ban’.” “Glory hallelu! Gwine a put on mah shoe, And walk all ober heb’n jus’ a singin’ thro’ de lan.”  Mellow notes, Fluted throats, Whispering the chorus of an old forgotten song, Sweet and low, Swinging so, Sighing like the evening breeze that gently sweeps along. 
I see shining black hair smoothed back on round dark foreheads. And agile bodies sway, from side to side, like trees cradled by a rhythmic wind. Tom-toms thud ... thud ... thud. I hear the soft gurgle of rippling waters; the jubilation of the jungle moon, laughing with the stars; and the howl of the jackal in the tangled bush. I hear the soft, pure music of angels, and the loud quick cacophony of demons, blended in concert all together.
YOU are like a melody that comes floating to me , over the quiet of a summer day when all is calm and noon-day zephyrs trill along warmed by the glowing sun, a ball of gilded fire, . . . a song. YOU are like a garden in the spring when the buds ache as they painfully-—joyfully—burst the bonds that held them fast during winter, for their arrival is a beautiful thing and so is the awakening of life ... to a maid. YOU are spring— the springtime of life, for your eyes glow as life's piteous— joyous—aching—ecstatic secrets are unfurled to you; you live again the same joy, the same life, that the trees live and die with them—as they do.
